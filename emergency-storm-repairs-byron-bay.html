            <h1>Emergency Storm Repairs Byron Bay - What to Do First</h1>

            <p>Cyclone season hits Byron Bay hard. February-March especially - we get these massive storm cells rolling in from the ocean. 100km/h winds, driving rain sideways, hail. Your roof lifts, windows smash, fence blows over, water pours into your house.</p>

            <p>I get about 30 storm damage callouts every cyclone season around Byron. Sunrise Beach, Belongil, Suffolk Park - anywhere exposed to east wind cops it. Same problems every time.</p>

            <p>Here's what to do when a storm damages your Byron Bay property.</p>

            <div class="urgent-box">
                <h3>⚠️ URGENT - Do These FIRST</h3>
                <p><strong>If water's actively coming in or property isn't secure:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn off power at the main switchboard if water's near electrics</li>
                    <li>Stop water coming in - tarp the roof, block broken windows with boards/plastic</li>
                    <li>Secure your property - broken doors/windows are security risks</li>
                    <li>Move valuables away from water leaks</li>
                    <li>Document everything with photos for insurance</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Then call for help.</strong> Emergency repairs in Byron Bay: <a href="tel:0481457271" style="color: #742A2A; text-decoration: underline;">0481 457271</a></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Fix These Issues IMMEDIATELY (Same Day)</h2>

            <p>Some damage can wait. Some damage gets exponentially worse every hour. Here's what needs fixing right now:</p>

            <h3>1. Active Roof Leaks</h3>

            <p>Water coming through your ceiling will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Destroy ceiling plaster (soggy, collapses, Contact for quote-3,000 to replace)</li>
                <li>Rot ceiling joists (structural, Contact for quote-8,000)</li>
                <li>Damage electrics (dangerous, expensive)</li>
                <li>Grow mold within 48 hours (health hazard, expensive remediation)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Temporary fix:</strong> Tarp the roof from outside. Blue poly tarp from Bunnings (Contact for quote-80 depending on size). Weight it down with sandbags or timber. Doesn't look pretty but stops water getting in.</p>

            <p><strong>Proper fix:</strong> Replace damaged roof sheeting, flashing, or tiles. Byron Bay roofs cop a beating - iron rusts through from salt air, tiles crack from hail and heat cycles. Cost: Contact for quote-2,500 for typical storm damage repairs.</p>

            <p>Can't get on your roof safely? Don't. Call someone. Broken leg costs more than a callout.</p>

            <h3>2. Broken Windows or Doors</h3>

            <p>Broken glass = two problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Security - anyone can walk in</li>
                <li>Weather - rain/wind blowing through ruins everything</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Temporary fix:</strong> Board it up. 12mm ply from hardware store, screw it over the opening from inside. Or heavy plastic sheeting if you need light.</p>

            <p><strong>Proper fix:</strong> Replace the glass or window. Byron glaziers are usually booked solid for weeks after a big storm - everyone's got broken windows. If you can source the glass yourself and it's a simple frame, I can fit it same-day.</p>

            <h3>3. Compromised Security</h3>

            <p>Doors blown in, locks broken, windows smashed - your property's not secure.</p>

            <p>Priority fix because Byron has property crime. Opportunists drive around after storms looking for unsecured houses.</p>

            <p><strong>Temporary:</strong> Board it, padlock what you can, get someone to stay there if it's really bad.</p>

            <p><strong>Proper fix:</strong> New locks, doors, security screens. Contact for quote-800 depending on what's damaged.</p>

            <h2>Fix These Within 24-48 Hours</h2>

            <p>Not immediately urgent but will cause bigger problems if ignored:</p>

            <h3>Fence Damage</h3>

            <p>Panels down, posts leaning, gates hanging off. Not urgent for safety but:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dogs get out</li>
                <li>Neighbors get annoyed</li>
                <li>Looks terrible</li>
                <li>If it's a pool fence - illegal to leave it broken (safety regs)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Byron Bay fences cop 100km/h easterlies straight off the ocean. Colorbond usually just bends. Timber tends to snap.</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-800 to fix typical fence damage. Full fence rebuild Contact for quote-8,000 depending on length.</p>

            <h3>Gutter Damage</h3>

            <p>Gutters ripped off, downpipes torn away, hangers broken.</p>

            <p>Seems minor but broken gutters dump water right next to your foundation. In Byron's clay soil, that undermines foundations and causes cracks. Seen it heaps in older Sunrise Beach homes.</p>

            <p>Fix within 48 hours, before next rain.</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-450 for typical gutter repairs.</p>

            <h3>Deck Damage</h3>

            <p>Boards lifted, railings broken, stairs damaged.</p>

            <p>Safety issue if someone uses the deck - broken boards collapse, people fall through. Seen this twice in Byron. Not fun.</p>

            <p>Cover it or fence it off till it's fixed. Then replace damaged boards.</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-900 depending on how much of the deck's damaged.</p>

            <h2>Can Wait A Week (But Don't Ignore)</h2>

            <p>These won't get dramatically worse in a few days, but need fixing soon:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minor roof damage (but not leaking):</strong> Missing ridge caps, loose sheeting that hasn't holed yet</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmetic damage:</strong> Paint blown off, trim boards damaged but not structural</li>
                <li><strong>Garden/landscaping:</strong> Trees down (unless they're on something), plant damage</li>
                <li><strong>Outdoor structures:</strong> Damaged sheds, carports (if not about to collapse)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Byron Bay Storm Damage Patterns</h2>

            <p>After every cyclone season, I see the same areas get hit:</p>

            <p><strong>Belongil/beachfront:</strong> Cop the worst wind. Roofs lift (especially older iron roofs with rusty screws), windows smash from flying debris, fences blow down. East-facing properties get smashed.</p>

            <p><strong>Suffolk Park/Sunrise:</strong> High exposure. Lots of deck damage from wind, outdoor furniture destroyed, pergola damage common. Trees come down on houses fairly regularly.</p>

            <p><strong>Byron town:</strong> More sheltered but still get damage. Mainly older buildings - roof tiles, window damage, fences. Heritage buildings around Jonson Street cop it.</p>

            <p><strong>Hinterland (Bangalow Road, Ewingsdale):</strong> Big trees = falling branches. Deck damage from debris. Road access blocked by fallen trees.</p>

            <h2>Insurance Claims - Document Everything</h2>

            <p>Do this before fixing anything major:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photos of all damage</strong> - multiple angles, close-ups, wide shots showing context</li>
                <li><strong>Video walkthrough</strong> - especially water damage (shows extent better than photos)</li>
                <li><strong>Keep damaged materials</strong> - insurance may want to inspect broken tiles, wood, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Get quotes in writing</strong> - most Byron insurers want written quotes before approving repairs</li>
                <li><strong>Keep all receipts</strong> - even for tarps and temporary fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Byron Bay post-storm, every tradie and builder is slammed. Insurance assessors are booked 2-3 weeks out. Document everything yourself immediately - don't wait for the assessor.</p>

            <h2>Preventing Storm Damage (Before Next Season)</h2>

            <p>February-March is cyclone season. Do this before summer:</p>

            <h3>Roof Maintenance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check all roof screws - replace rusty ones with marine stainless (iron roofs lift when screws corrode)</li>
                <li>Replace cracked or broken tiles</li>
                <li>Re-seal flashing around chimneys, vents</li>
                <li>Clean gutters (blocked gutters overflow, water gets under roof)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Windows & Doors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check all latches work properly</li>
                <li>Replace perished window seals</li>
                <li>Security screens (protect glass from debris)</li>
                <li>Storm shutters for beachfront properties (expensive but worth it)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fence & Structures:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check fence posts are solid - replace wobbly ones</li>
                <li>Reinforce gates</li>
                <li>Trim trees back from house (big branches = roof damage)</li>
                <li>Secure outdoor furniture (it becomes flying missiles in 100km/h wind)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Deck Safety:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check all deck boards are screwed down properly</li>
                <li>Check structure underneath isn't rotten</li>
                <li>Secure or store deck furniture before storms hit</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to Have Ready Before Storm Season</h2>

            <p>Keep these at your property (Byron hardware stores sell out fast when storms are forecast):</p>

            <ul>
                <li>6x4m blue poly tarp (Contact for quote-80)</li>
                <li>Sandbags or similar weights</li>
                <li>12mm ply sheets (2-3 sheets for boarding windows)</li>
                <li>Cordless drill with charged batteries</li>
                <li>50mm screws (for emergency boarding)</li>
                <li>Heavy duty garbage bags (water damage cleanup)</li>
                <li>Torch and batteries</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The 24 Hours After a Byron Bay Storm</h2>

            <p>Big storm hits overnight. Here's what happens next day in Byron:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Every tradie's phone blows up with callouts</li>
                <li>Bunnings runs out of tarps, ply, sandbags by 10am</li>
                <li>Most tradies are booked 1-2 weeks out for non-emergency work</li>
                <li>Emergency repairs get prioritized (water coming in, security issues)</li>
                <li>Insurance assessors booked weeks ahead</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is why you need a local handyman's number saved <em>before</em> the storm. Trying to find someone after the storm hits - everyone's slammed.</p>

            <p>I prioritize emergency work (active leaks, security) during storm season. Cosmetic stuff waits. If water's coming into your house or property's not secure, that's priority one.</p>

            <h2>When to Call Emergency Services vs A Handyman</h2>

            <p><strong>Call SES (132 500):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tree fallen on house</li>
                <li>Major structural damage</li>
                <li>Roof completely gone</li>
                <li>Flooding inside property</li>
                <li>Power lines down</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Call a handyman/tradie:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Roof leaking but structure sound</li>
                <li>Window/door damage</li>
                <li>Fence down</li>
                <li>Deck damage</li>
                <li>Gutter damage</li>
                <li>Minor to moderate repairs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>SES is free but they're volunteers and get slammed during storms. They do emergency stuff only - make it safe, not fix it properly. Then you need a tradie for permanent repairs anyway.</p>
