                        <p>When your Byron Bay home suffers sudden damage - a broken door that won't close, a lock that's failed leaving you locked out, or a hole in the wall from an accident - you need immediate professional repair services. These urgent issues can't wait until morning or regular business hours. They compromise your security, safety, and peace of mind right now.</p>

                        <p>Our comprehensive <a href="emergency-repairs.html">24/7 emergency repair services</a> specialize in immediate fixes for the most common urgent home problems that Byron Bay residents face, from broken doors and failed locks to damaged walls and loose floorboards.</p>

                        <h2>Broken Door Emergency Repairs</h2>

                        <h3>Front Door Security Failures</h3>

                        <p>A broken front door is a serious security emergency. Whether the door frame has split from forced entry attempt, the door itself has warped and won't close properly, or the hinges have failed completely, your home's security is compromised until professional repairs are completed.</p>

                        <p>Our emergency door repair service includes immediate temporary securing of the opening, professional assessment of damage, and rapid permanent repairs or replacement. We carry a range of door hardware, reinforcement materials, and temporary security solutions to restore your home's protection immediately.</p>

                        <p>Common front door emergencies we handle include split door frames from attempted break-ins, warped doors that won't latch properly, damaged hinges causing doors to sag or bind, and broken door handles or deadbolts that leave you locked out or unable to secure your home.</p>

                        <h3>Internal Door Problems</h3>

                        <p>Broken internal doors can disrupt your daily life and privacy, especially in busy household situations or rental properties with guests. Our emergency team provides rapid repairs for internal doors including bedroom doors that won't close properly, bathroom doors with broken locks, and closet doors that have come off their tracks.</p>

                        <p>We also handle emergency repairs for sliding doors, pocket doors, and bi-fold doors that have suffered mechanical failures, ensuring your home's functionality is restored quickly and efficiently.</p>

                        <h2>Lock and Security Hardware Emergencies</h2>

                        <h3>Lockout Emergency Services</h3>

                        <p>Being locked out of your Byron Bay home, especially late at night or during severe weather, requires immediate professional assistance. Our emergency locksmiths provide rapid lockout resolution using non-destructive entry techniques that preserve your locks and door hardware.</p>

                        <p>Whether you're locked out due to a broken key, malfunctioning lock mechanism, or simply lost keys, we provide immediate access restoration with minimal damage to your property. Our emergency team carries lock-picking tools, bump keys, and electronic lock bypass equipment for various lock types.</p>

                        <p>For holiday rental properties, lockout emergencies can be particularly disruptive to guests.

                        <h3>Broken Lock Mechanisms</h3>

                        <p>Lock mechanisms can fail suddenly, leaving you unable to secure your property or access your home.

                        <p>Our emergency lock repair service includes immediate assessment of lock functionality, temporary security measures if needed, and rapid repair or replacement using high-quality hardware designed for Byron Bay's coastal environment.</p>

                        <p>Accidents happen - furniture moving gone wrong, door handles hitting walls, or impact damage from various causes can create holes in walls that need immediate attention.

                        <p>Water-damaged walls often require immediate opening for inspection and drying, temporary waterproofing, and emergency structural support if load-bearing elements are affected. Quick response prevents minor water damage from becoming major reconstruction projects.</p>

                        <h3>Broken Window Glass</h3>

                        <p>Broken windows create immediate security and weather protection issues that can't wait for regular business hours. Whether broken by storms, accidents, or attempted break-ins, damaged windows need immediate professional attention.</p>

                        <p>Our emergency glazing service includes immediate boarding of broken windows, temporary weather sealing, and emergency glass replacement where possible. We carry various glass types, temporary boarding materials, and weather sealing products for immediate protection.</p>

                        <p>Broken sliding door glass or failed mechanisms create security vulnerabilities and weather protection issues. Our emergency team provides immediate repairs for sliding door problems including broken glass, failed rollers, damaged tracks, and lock mechanism failures.</p>

                        <p>Sliding door emergencies often require temporary securing of openings, immediate weather protection, and rapid mechanism repairs to restore security and functionality.</p>

                        <p>A hole in your deck creates immediate safety hazards and potential liability issues, especially if you have guests or rental property situations. Deck holes can result from rot, impact damage, or structural failure that requires immediate professional attention.</p>

                        <p>Our emergency deck repair service includes immediate assessment of hole severity, temporary safety barriers if needed, emergency patching to prevent accidents, and structural evaluation to ensure deck safety.

                        <h3>Broken Deck Railings</h3>

                        <p>Broken deck railings pose serious fall hazards that require immediate repair, especially on elevated decks. Our emergency team provides immediate temporary barriers, rapid railing repairs, and safety assessments to prevent accidents.</p>

                        <p>Railing emergencies include broken balusters, loose handrails, damaged posts, and any structural compromise that affects the railing's ability to prevent falls from elevated areas.</p>

                        <h2>Fence Emergency Repairs</h2>
