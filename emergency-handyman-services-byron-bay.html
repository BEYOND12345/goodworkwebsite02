                        <h3>On-Site Emergency Response</h3>

                        <p>Upon arrival, our emergency team conducts immediate safety assessment, implements emergency protective measures, and begins temporary repairs to prevent further damage. All emergency work prioritizes safety and damage prevention before cosmetic or permanent repairs.</p>
