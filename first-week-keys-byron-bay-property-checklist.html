            <h1>What to Do the Week You Get the Keys to a Byron Property</h1>

            <p>You've got the keys. Settlement's done, the property is officially yours. Now what? If you're like most Byron Bay buyers, you're either overwhelmed with the amount to do, or you're not sure where to start. I work with new property owners every week who are standing in their empty Byron Bay house wondering what needs to happen before they can actually move in or get tenants in.</p>

            <p>The first week after getting keys is critical. This is when you discover the stuff the building inspector missed, when you figure out what actually needs fixing urgently, and when you set up the property properly. Here's exactly what to do in that first week — whether you're planning to live in the property yourself or rent it out.</p>

            <h2>Day 1: Walk Through with a Notepad</h2>

            <p>Don't start fixing things yet. Day one is about seeing everything with fresh eyes and documenting it. Walk through the entire property — inside and out — with a notepad or your phone to take notes.</p>

            <p>Check:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Every room (walls, ceiling, floors)</li>
                <li>All windows and doors (do they open, close, lock?)</li>
                <li>Kitchen cupboards and drawers</li>
                <li>Bathroom condition</li>
                <li>Electrical (test lights, switches, power points)</li>
                <li>Hot water (turn it on, see how long it takes to heat)</li>
                <li>Outdoor areas (deck, garden, fencing)</li>
                <li>Under the house (if accessible)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Take lots of photos. This creates a record of the property's condition on settlement day, which is useful for insurance and also helps you track what's been fixed later.</p>

            <p>Common things new Byron Bay owners discover on day one: doors that don't close properly, kitchen cupboards with broken hinges, deck boards that are rotted, blocked gutters, torn flyscreens, and minor water damage that wasn't obvious during the inspection.</p>

            <h2>Day 2: Test Everything That Should Work</h2>

            <p>Day two is about functionality testing. Go through systematically and test everything:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hot water:</strong> Run every tap until it gets hot. Check it's actually heating properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Oven and cooktop:</strong> Turn on every element and the oven. Make sure they all work.</li>
                <li><strong>Toilets:</strong> Flush them. Check they refill properly and don't run continuously.</li>
                <li><strong>Taps:</strong> Turn every tap on full. Check for leaks under sinks while running.</li>
                <li><strong>Lights and fans:</strong> Test every light switch, ceiling fan, and exhaust fan.</li>
                <li><strong>Locks:</strong> Test every door and window lock. Make sure they actually secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Garage door/remotes:</strong> If you have a garage, test the door and remotes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you find things that don't work, add them to your fix list with priority levels: <strong>Urgent</strong> (affects safety or habitability), <strong>Important</strong> (annoying but not critical), <strong>Can Wait</strong> (cosmetic or nice-to-have).</p>

            <p>I had new owners in Bangalow discover on day two that their oven didn't work — heating element was dead. Building inspector hadn't tested it. If they'd waited until move-in day to discover that, it would've been a nightmare. Finding it early meant they got it repaired before moving in.</p>

            <h2>Day 3: Check for Water Leaks and Moisture</h2>

            <p>Day three is moisture day. Byron Bay's humidity and weather means water leaks and moisture problems are common. Check:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Under all sinks:</strong> Look for water stains, dampness, or active leaks</li>
                <li><strong>Around toilets:</strong> Check the base for water or moisture</li>
                <li><strong>Bathroom ceilings and walls:</strong> Look for water stains or soft spots</li>
                <li><strong>Window frames:</strong> Check sills for rot or water damage</li>
                <li><strong>Under the house:</strong> Look for standing water or damp areas</li>
                <li><strong>Roof (from inside):</strong> Go in the roof cavity with a torch if accessible and look for daylight (holes) or water stains on timber</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you find active leaks, get them fixed immediately. Water damage gets expensive fast in Byron Bay. A small roof leak can turn into a $5,000 ceiling repair if left for months.</p>

            <p>Also check for mold — inside cupboards, wardrobes, bathrooms, laundries. If the property's been vacant for a while, Byron Bay's humidity breeds mold. Treat it now before you move your belongings in.</p>

            <h2>Day 4-5: Get Urgent Repairs Done</h2>

            <p>By day four or five, you should have a clear list of what's urgent. Get those repairs organized immediately. Don't wait until after you've moved in — it's easier and faster to fix things while the property's still empty.</p>

            <p>Common urgent repairs on Byron Bay properties:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Leaking taps or toilets (wasting water, can cause damage)</li>
                <li>Doors or windows that won't lock (security issue)</li>
                <li>Electrical issues (sparking switches, non-working power points)</li>
                <li>Hot water system not working</li>
                <li>Damaged or missing flyscreens (you'll get eaten alive by mosquitoes)</li>
                <li>Deck boards that are rotted or dangerous (safety issue)</li>
                <li>Gutters full of debris (next rain will overflow and cause damage)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you're still interstate, this is when you need a reliable local tradie who can access the property and get the work done. I handle dozens of these urgent pre-move-in repairs every year for Byron Bay property owners who are coordinating everything remotely.</p>

            <h2>Day 6: Set Up Utilities and Services</h2>

            <p>Assuming you're planning to live in the property or rent it out, you need utilities connected. Day six is admin day:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> Transfer to your name or set up new account</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Contact Byron Shire Council to transfer the water account</li>
                <li><strong>Gas:</strong> If the property has gas, get it connected/transferred</li>
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Order internet connection (can take 2-4 weeks in Byron Bay, so do this early)</li>
                <li><strong>Council rates:</strong> You'll get a notice from Byron Shire Council, but check your account is set up correctly</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Get building and contents insurance active from settlement day</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Also organize mail redirection if you're moving in, or set up a mailbox system if it's a rental.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay internet can be frustrating — some areas have fast NBN, others are still on slow connections. Order early and don't assume it'll be connected in a week.</p>

            <h2>Day 7: Final Inspection and Plan Next Steps</h2>

            <p>On day seven, do one more complete walk-through. Check that urgent repairs are done (or scheduled), utilities are being connected, and you have a clear plan for the next phase.</p>

            <p>Decide:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What still needs fixing before move-in/tenant move-in?</li>
                <li>What can wait until after you're living there?</li>
                <li>Do you need professional cleaning?</li>
                <li>Is the garden/outdoor area presentable?</li>
                <li>Are there any security concerns (broken locks, easy access points)?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you're renting the property out, this is when you finalize with your property manager about condition reports, key handover, and move-in dates.</p>

            <p>If you're moving in yourself, finalize your moving date based on what still needs to be done. Don't rush it — better to delay the move by a week and arrive to a fully functional property than move in while urgent repairs are still happening.</p>

            <div class="checklist">

            <h2>Common Mistakes New Byron Bay Owners Make</h2>

            <p>I see new owners make the same mistakes in that first week:</p>

            <p><strong>Rushing to move in before repairs are done:</strong> You'll be living in chaos trying to fix things around your furniture and belongings. Do repairs while the place is empty.</p>

            <p><strong>Ignoring small issues:</strong> That dripping tap seems minor, but it's wasting water (expensive in Byron) and can cause damage. Fix small things before they become big problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Not testing everything:</strong> Assume nothing works until you've tested it. Building inspectors don't test appliances, locks, or minor fixtures.</p>

            <p><strong>Delaying utility setup:</strong> Internet especially takes time in Byron Bay. Order it in week one, not week three when you're desperate for connection.</p>

            <p><strong>DIY-ing everything to save money:</strong> Some things are worth paying for — professional cleaning, qualified electricians for electrical issues, proper deck repairs. Doing it properly the first time is cheaper than fixing DIY mistakes later.</p>

            <h2>What This Week Actually Achieves</h2>

            <p>By the end of week one, you should have:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complete understanding of the property's condition</li>
                <li>Urgent repairs completed or scheduled</li>
                <li>Utilities connected or in progress</li>
                <li>Clear plan for remaining work before move-in</li>
                <li>Documentation (photos, notes) of everything</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This first week sets you up for a smooth move-in or rental preparation. The properties I see where new owners took this first week seriously are the ones where everything goes smoothly. The properties where owners rushed or skipped steps are the ones where I get emergency calls two weeks later for things that should've been dealt with immediately.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay property ownership is exciting, but coastal properties need attention. That first week after getting keys is your chance to properly assess what you've bought and fix anything urgent before it becomes a bigger problem.</p>

            <p>If you've just got keys to a Byron Bay or Northern Rivers property and need help with that first-week inspection and urgent repairs, send me a message. I work with new owners every week doing exactly this — walking through properties, identifying what needs fixing, and getting it sorted quickly while you're coordinating from interstate or before you arrive.</p>
