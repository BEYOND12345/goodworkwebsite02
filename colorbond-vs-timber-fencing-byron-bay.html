                        <p>Choosing between Colorbond and timber fencing for your Byron Bay property requires understanding how each material performs in coastal conditions. Salt air, humidity, UV exposure, and storm weather create unique challenges that affect fence durability, maintenance requirements, and long-term value. The wrong choice can mean expensive replacement in just a few years.</p>

                        <p>Our extensive experience with both <a href="colorbond-fence-installation-byron-bay.html">Colorbond fence installation</a> and timber fencing in Byron Bay provides real-world insights into which material works best for different property types and coastal exposures.</p>

                        <h2>Coastal Performance Comparison</h2>

                        <h3>Salt Air Resistance</h3>

                        <p>Byron Bay's salt air environment poses the greatest challenge for fence materials, with ocean spray and coastal humidity accelerating corrosion and deterioration.
