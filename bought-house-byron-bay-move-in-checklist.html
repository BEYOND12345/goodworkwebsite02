            <h1>Just Bought a House in Byron Bay? Here's Your Move-In Readiness Checklist</h1>

            <p>Congratulations on buying property in Byron Bay. I know how exciting this is — and also how overwhelming it can feel, especially if you're still interstate sorting out the move. I work with new property owners around Byron Bay every week, and I see the same stress points come up: What needs fixing before move-in? What's urgent and what can wait? Who can I trust to handle it while I'm still in Melbourne or Brisbane?</p>

            <p>The good news is that getting a Byron Bay property move-in ready doesn't have to be complicated. What matters is having someone local who knows what to look for, can communicate clearly, and will send you photos so you know the work's being done properly. That's what I do — and here's the checklist I follow when preparing a property for new owners.</p>

            <h2>Start with a Thorough Walk-Through Inspection</h2>

            <p>Before you do anything else, you need a proper inspection. Not the building inspector's report you got before settlement — that tells you if the house is structurally sound. I'm talking about a practical, move-in focused inspection that tells you what needs fixing, painting, or replacing before you arrive with the furniture truck.</p>

            <p>I usually spend 90 minutes walking through a Byron Bay property with a notepad. I'm checking:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Every door and window (do they open, close, lock properly?)</li>
                <li>Timber decks for rot, loose boards, or splinters</li>
                <li>Kitchen cupboards and hinges (humidity makes them sag)</li>
                <li>Screens for tears or missing mesh</li>
                <li>Gutters and downpipes for blockages</li>
                <li>Exterior paint condition and timber damage</li>
                <li>Bathroom grouting and any moisture damage</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Then I send you a photo report with cost estimates for each fix. This way, you know exactly what you're dealing with before you even arrive in Byron Bay.</p>

            <h2>Check the Timber Before You Move In</h2>

            <p>Byron Bay properties have a lot of timber — decks, window frames, weatherboards, pergolas. And timber in coastal areas takes a beating from salt air and humidity. If your property has a deck, walk on it carefully. Look for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Grey, splintered boards (means the oil's worn off and UV damage has started)</li>
                <li>Soft spots when you press down (rot underneath)</li>
                <li>Rusty nail heads staining the timber</li>
                <li>Loose or wobbly railings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I restored a deck in Suffolk Park last month for a couple who'd just bought sight-unseen. They arrived from Sydney to find half the deck boards rotted through. We replaced 12 boards, re-oiled the whole deck, and replaced all fixings with marine-grade stainless steel. Cost them $2,800, but it meant they could move in safely and actually use their outdoor space.</p>

            <p>Timber repairs are easier to do before your furniture arrives. Once you're living there, it's disruptive and you've got to move everything off the deck.</p>

            <h2>Don't Forget the Gutters</h2>

            <p>This sounds boring, but blocked gutters cause serious problems in Byron Bay's wet season. When gutters overflow, water runs down exterior walls, soaks into window frames, and can flood under the house. I've seen it damage ceilings, rot fascia boards, and create mold problems.</p>

            <p>Before you move in, get the gutters cleaned. In Byron Bay, you're dealing with gum leaves, palm fronds, and general coastal debris. If the previous owners didn't maintain them, they're probably full.</p>

            <p>Gutter cleaning for a standard 3-bedroom Byron Bay home costs $180-$280. Takes me about 2 hours, and I'll tell you if any sections need repairing while I'm up there.</p>

            <h2>Test Everything That Opens, Closes, or Locks</h2>

            <p>Humidity in Byron Bay makes timber swell. Doors that closed fine six months ago might now stick, drag, or refuse to latch. Windows can jam. Locks can seize up.</p>

            <p>Before you move in, I go through every door and window and make sure they work properly. This usually means:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Planing down swollen door edges</li>
                <li>Adjusting hinges</li>
                <li>Lubricating locks and latches</li>
                <li>Replacing broken window winders</li>
                <li>Fixing screen doors that won't close</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's small stuff, but it makes a huge difference when you're moving in. You don't want to be fighting with a stuck bathroom door on your first night in the house.</p>

            <h2>Look for Moisture and Mold</h2>

            <p>Moisture and mold are real in Byron Bay. It's not always obvious — sometimes it's hidden in cupboards, behind furniture, or under sinks. But if your property's been vacant for a few months, or if the previous owners didn't ventilate well, you might find it.</p>

            <p>Check:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bathroom ceilings and corners (common mold spots)</li>
                <li>Under kitchen and bathroom sinks</li>
                <li>Inside wardrobes and cupboards</li>
                <li>Around window frames (especially timber ones)</li>
                <li>Laundry areas and any poorly ventilated rooms</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you find mold, don't just wipe it off. You need to treat it properly and fix the moisture source. I use a mold treatment solution and then make sure there's ventilation or repair any leaks causing the problem.</p>

            <h2>Get Any Painting Done Now</h2>

            <p>If rooms need repainting, do it before you move in. It's faster, cleaner, and cheaper when the house is empty. Painters can move quickly without furniture in the way, and you're not living in paint fumes.</p>

            <p>In Byron Bay, I usually recommend repainting:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Any rooms with marks, scuffs, or tired-looking walls</li>
                <li>Exterior timber that's weathered or peeling</li>
                <li>Bathroom ceilings if there's any discoloration</li>
                <li>Window frames and doors (fresh paint protects the timber)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For a 3-bedroom Byron Bay house, interior repainting typically runs $3,500-$6,000 depending on prep work needed. Exterior painting is $5,000-$12,000 depending on the size and condition.</p>

            <h2>Make Sure It's Actually Clean</h2>

            <p>Most settlements include an "exit clean" from the previous owners. But the standards vary wildly. I've walked into Byron Bay properties where the "clean" meant a quick vacuum and wipe-down, but the oven's filthy, the shower's got soap scum, and there's dust everywhere.</p>

            <p>If you want the place genuinely clean before you move in, hire a proper cleaner or include it as part of your property prep. A thorough clean (oven, bathrooms, windows, floors, cupboards) for a 3-bedroom house in Byron Bay costs around $350-$500.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>✓ Professional walk-through inspection with photo report</li>
                    <li>✓ Timber deck and exterior timber condition check</li>
                    <li>✓ Gutter cleaning and roof inspection</li>
                    <li>✓ All doors, windows, locks tested and adjusted</li>
                    <li>✓ Moisture and mold inspection and treatment</li>
                    <li>✓ Kitchen cupboards and hinges checked</li>
                    <li>✓ Fly screens repaired or replaced</li>
                    <li>✓ Any urgent painting completed</li>
                    <li>✓ Thorough professional clean</li>
                    <li>✓ Minor repairs completed (handles, fixtures, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Working with Remote Property Owners</h2>

            <p>Most of my Byron Bay property prep work is for owners who are still interstate. They've bought the property but won't be moving in for another month or two, and they need someone local who can handle everything.</p>

            <p>Here's how I make that work:</p>

            <p><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> I send detailed text updates and photos at each stage. You see what I'm seeing — the problem, the fix, and the finished result.</p>

            <p><strong>Transparent Quotes:</strong> I provide a written quote before starting any work. No surprises, no hidden costs. If I find additional issues during the job, I message you with photos and a price before proceeding.</p>

            <p><strong>Flexible Timing:</strong> I work around your settlement dates and moving schedule. Need everything done in a week? I'll prioritize it. Got six weeks? We can space out the work to suit your budget.</p>

            <p><strong>One Point of Contact:</strong> You deal with me directly. I coordinate any additional trades if needed (electricians, plumbers, painters). You don't have to chase five different people.</p>

            <p>I've prepared properties for new owners from Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, even a couple from Perth. The process works because I treat your property like I'd want mine treated — with care, clear communication, and professional results.</p>

            <h2>What This Actually Costs</h2>

            <p>Every property is different, but here's what move-in prep typically costs for a standard 3-bedroom Byron Bay house:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walk-through inspection and report:</strong> $120-$180</li>
                <li><strong>Gutter cleaning:</strong> $180-$280</li>
                <li><strong>Minor repairs (doors, hinges, handles):</strong> $200-$500</li>
                <li><strong>Deck cleaning and re-oiling:</strong> $600-$1,200</li>
                <li><strong>Fly screen repairs:</strong> $80-$150 per screen</li>
                <li><strong>Interior painting (per room):</strong> $600-$1,000</li>
                <li><strong>Professional clean:</strong> $350-$500</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Total for a typical move-in prep (inspection, gutters, minor repairs, clean): <strong>$850-$1,500</strong></p>

            <p>If you need deck restoration, repainting, or more extensive repairs, budget $3,000-$8,000 depending on the property's condition.</p>

            <p>The key is prioritizing what actually matters for move-in day. You don't need to do everything at once. Fix what's urgent or affects livability, then schedule the cosmetic stuff for later.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Byron Bay Properties</h2>

            <p>Byron Bay property maintenance isn't like Brisbane or Sydney. The coastal environment is harsher on buildings. Salt air corrodes metal, UV is intense, humidity causes mold and timber swelling, and the rental market here is demanding.</p>

            <p>Getting your property move-in ready properly means:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You arrive to a home that's safe, clean, and functional</li>
                <li>No urgent repairs disrupting your first few weeks</li>
                <li>Timber and paintwork protected for the long term</li>
                <li>If you're renting it out, tenants move into a property that meets expectations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I work across Byron Bay, Lennox Head, Bangalow, and the broader Northern Rivers. Every property is different, but the process is the same: inspect thoroughly, communicate clearly, fix what matters, and make sure you're happy with the result.</p>

            <p>If you've just bought in Byron Bay and need help getting the property ready, send me a message. I'll walk through it, send you a photo report, and give you a clear quote for what needs doing.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Byron Bay — let's get your place sorted properly.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Ideally 4-6 weeks before your move-in date. This gives you time to organize any repairs while the property is still empty. If you're on a tighter timeline, I can often fit inspections in within a week.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">Do you coordinate all the repairs or just inspect?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">I do both. I can inspect and provide a report for you to organize repairs yourself, or I can handle everything—inspection, coordinating trades, completing repairs, and sending you progress updates. Most interstate owners prefer the full service.</p>
