            <h1>5 Common Kitchen Repairs in Byron Bay Coastal Homes</h1>

            <p>Look, I fix a lot of kitchens around Byron Bay. And honestly? The same stuff breaks over and over. Living 400m from the beach, I see this every week - humidity gets into everything, salt air corrodes whatever it touches, and your kitchen cupboards just slowly fall apart.</p>

            <p>Here's what actually breaks in Byron Bay kitchens and what you can do about it.</p>

            <h2>1. Cupboard Doors Won't Close Properly</h2>

            <p>This is the number one callout. Your cupboard doors are either hanging wonky, won't stay closed, or you've got that annoying gap where they don't line up anymore.</p>

            <p>Cause? Usually the hinges. Byron Bay's humidity kills cheap hinges in about 2 years. They rust, the screws strip out of swollen chipboard, or the hinge cups crack. Sometimes it's the doors themselves warping from moisture - especially on beach-facing kitchens in Belongil, Suffolk Park, Wategos.</p>

            <p>Quick fix: Tighten the adjustment screws on your hinges first. Those little Phillips head screws can adjust up/down and in/out. Takes 5 minutes.</p>

            <p>Proper fix: Replace with marine-grade stainless steel hinges. Yeah they cost more (Contact for quote-12 per hinge vs Contact for quote for the cheap ones), but they'll actually last. I use Blum or Hettich hinges on coastal properties - both have proper corrosion resistance.</p>

            <h2>2. Drawer Runners Are Stuffed</h2>

            <p>Your drawers stick, won't close all the way, or fall off the runners when you pull them out. Super annoying when you're trying to cook and your cutlery drawer jams.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay problem: Salt air + cheap metal runners = rust city. The ball bearings seize up, rollers stop rolling. I've pulled out runners that are basically orange rust sculptures.</p>

            <p>Fix: Replace with soft-close runners. Not because soft-close is fancy - because quality soft-close runners use better materials that handle coastal conditions. Blum Tandem or Hettich QuadroV6 runners are what I fit. Cost about Contact for quote-60 per drawer but they'll outlast your kitchen.</p>

            <p>Pro tip: Get full extension runners. Pull the whole drawer out so you can actually see what's at the back. Game changer.</p>

            <h2>3. Chipboard Swelling Around The Sink</h2>

            <p>The cabinet floor under your sink is soft, spongy, or straight-up falling apart. This happens in probably 60% of Byron Bay kitchens I see - especially Arts & Industry Estate homes, older Sunrise Beach places, anywhere with the original 90s kitchen.</p>

            <p>What's happening: Water leaks (usually from the sink waste or tap connections) + humidity = chipboard swells up like a sponge. Once it starts, it doesn't stop. Just gets worse.</p>

            <p>The fix: Cut out all the damaged chipboard. Replace with marine ply or proper moisture-resistant board. Seal all edges with waterproof coating. Fix whatever was leaking.</p>

            <p>Cost: Usually Contact for quote-350 depending on how bad it is. But if you ignore it, the whole cabinet eventually collapses and you're looking at Local Expert to replace the whole sink base unit.</p>

            <h2>4. Benchtop Lifting or Delaminating</h2>

            <p>Your laminate benchtop is lifting at the edges or around the sink cutout. Or worse - the laminate is peeling away from the chipboard underneath.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay special: This happens fast near windows or anywhere steam escapes. I see it heaps in Bangalow Road homes, beachfront properties, anywhere with ocean views (because those windows are open all the time getting salty humid air through).</p>

            <p>Prevention: Keep benchtops dry. Wipe up water immediately - especially around sinks and cooktops. Use your rangehood fan.</p>

            <p>Repair options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small lifting (under 50mm):</strong> Glue and clamp it back down. Araldite works. Contact for quote-180.</li>
                <li><strong>Delamination spreading:</strong> Cut out that section, patch with new laminate if you can match it. Contact for quote-450.</li>
                <li><strong>Whole benchtop gone:</strong> Replace it. Stone's popular in Byron now - lasts forever in coastal conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Soft-Close Mechanisms Failed</h2>

            <p>Your soft-close drawers suddenly slam shut like they're angry. Or cupboard doors close the first 80% soft, then bang hard at the end.</p>

            <p>Not a huge problem, but super annoying. And if you've got holiday rental guests, they'll mention it in reviews (ask me how I know - I fix heaps of Airbnb kitchens around Byron).</p>

            <p>Cause: The dampers wear out. Cheap soft-close mechanisms last maybe 3-4 years in Byron's humidity. Quality ones last 10+.</p>

            <p>Fix: Replace the damper units. For drawers, that's usually the whole runner (Contact for quote-60 per drawer). For cupboard doors, you can sometimes just replace the damper part (Contact for quote-25 per door). Takes about 20 minutes per unit.</p>

            <h2>Why This Stuff Breaks Faster in Byron Bay</h2>

            <p>People from Sydney or inland move here and wonder why their kitchen falls apart in 5 years when it lasted 15 years at their old place.</p>

            <p>Simple: You're living in a salt-air, high-humidity environment. Your kitchen's 800m from the ocean? That's coastal. 2km away? Still coastal. Byron Bay's basically an island - sea air comes in from every direction.</p>

            <p>What this means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metal corrodes faster (hinges, runners, screws)</li>
                <li>Wood and chipboard absorb moisture and swell</li>
                <li>Adhesives break down quicker</li>
                <li>Moving parts (hinges, drawers) seize up from salt buildup</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's not your fault. It's not even necessarily bad quality kitchens (though yeah, cheap kitchens die faster). It's just Byron Bay being Byron Bay.</p>

            <h2>When to Call Someone vs DIY</h2>

            <p><strong>You can DIY:</strong> Tightening hinge adjustments, cleaning runners, replacing drawer fronts, fixing small laminate lifting.</p>

            <p><strong>Call someone:</strong> Water-damaged chipboard replacement (need proper moisture-resistant materials), benchtop work (easy to make it worse), anything involving plumbing connections, full door or drawer runner replacement if you don't have the right tools.</p>

            <p>Cost guide for Byron Bay:</p>

            <h2>Quick Maintenance Tips to Make Your Byron Kitchen Last</h2>

            <p>These actually work:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wipe up water immediately.</strong> Especially around sinks. Every single time.</li>
                <li><strong>Run your rangehood.</strong> Gets cooking humidity out before it condenses on cupboards.</li>
                <li><strong>Leave cupboard under sink slightly open overnight.</strong> Lets it dry out. Sounds weird but prevents that spongy chipboard thing.</li>
                <li><strong>Check hinges every 6 months.</strong> Tighten if needed. Replace at first sign of rust.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil drawer runners yearly.</strong> Couple drops of 3-in-1 oil keeps them sliding smooth.</li>
                <li><strong>Fix leaks immediately.</strong> That "small drip" under the sink kills the cabinet in 6 months.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Look, coastal living's great but it's hard on kitchens. These five problems - I see them every week around Byron Bay. The good news? They're all fixable. The sooner you deal with them, the cheaper the fix.</p>
