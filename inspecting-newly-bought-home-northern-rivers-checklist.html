            <h1>What I Look for When Inspecting a Newly Bought Home in the Northern Rivers</h1>

            <p>Every week I inspect newly bought properties in Byron Bay and the Northern Rivers for interstate owners who can't be on-site. They've just settled, and they need someone local to walk through the property and tell them exactly what they're dealing with. After hundreds of these inspections, I've developed a systematic checklist that catches the problems building inspectors miss and identifies what needs fixing before move-in.</p>

            <p>Here's what I look for when inspecting a newly bought Byron Bay or Northern Rivers property — the practical, livability-focused inspection that tells you if the place is actually ready for you to move into, or what work needs doing first.</p>

            <h2>Outside First: Decks and Outdoor Timber</h2>

            <p>I start outside because that's where Byron Bay's coastal environment causes the most problems. Decks, pergolas, and exterior timber cop salt air, UV, and weather daily.</p>

            <p><strong>What I Check on Decks:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walk every board:</strong> Feel for soft spots (rot underneath)</li>
                <li><strong>Check railings:</strong> Push them — they should be solid, not wobbly</li>
                <li><strong>Look under the deck:</strong> Inspect joists, bearers, and posts for rot or termites</li>
                <li><strong>Check all fixings:</strong> Look for rusted nails or screws staining timber</li>
                <li><strong>Test stairs:</strong> Walk up and down — loose or rotted stairs are dangerous</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I find deck problems on 60-70% of Byron Bay properties I inspect. Common issues: grey weathered boards needing re-oiling, rotted sections needing replacement, and wobbly railings that are safety hazards.</p>

            <p>Cost implications: Minor deck work $600-$1,200. Extensive deck restoration $2,000-$5,000.</p>

            <h2>Doors and Windows: The Humidity Test</h2>

            <p>Byron Bay humidity makes timber swell. I test every door and window in the property:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do doors open and close smoothly?</strong> Sticking doors need planing</li>
                <li><strong>Do latches work?</strong> Misaligned latches mean doors won't stay closed</li>
                <li><strong>Do locks function?</strong> Critical for security</li>
                <li><strong>Do windows open fully?</strong> Swollen frames prevent proper opening</li>
                <li><strong>Are seals intact?</strong> Failed seals let water in during rain</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I commonly find 3-5 doors per property that need adjustment. It's not expensive to fix ($15-30 per door), but it makes a huge difference to daily livability.</p>

            <h2>Kitchen: Cupboards and Functionality</h2>

            <p>Kitchens reveal a lot about how well a property's been maintained. I check:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Every cupboard door:</strong> Do they close properly or spring back open?</li>
                <li><strong>Hinges:</strong> Sagging hinges are common in Byron's humidity</li>
                <li><strong>Handles and knobs:</strong> Loose or missing?</li>
                <li><strong>Drawers:</strong> Do they slide smoothly or stick?</li>
                <li><strong>Benchtop condition:</strong> Water damage, cracks, or delamination?</li>
                <li><strong>Appliances (if included):</strong> Turn on the oven, cooktop — do they work?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Kitchen cupboards are one of the most common complaints from new Byron Bay owners. "Why won't these cupboards stay closed?" Because Byron's humidity has caused the hinges to sag and doors to swell.</p>

            <p>Fixing kitchen cupboards properly: $180-$350 for a full kitchen.</p>

            <h2>Bathrooms: Water and Moisture</h2>

            <p>Bathrooms are where water damage hides. I look for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Silicone condition:</strong> Cracked, stained, or peeling silicone lets water through</li>
                <li><strong>Grouting:</strong> Missing or cracked grout between tiles</li>
                <li><strong>Water stains:</strong> Ceiling or wall stains indicating leaks</li>
                <li><strong>Mold:</strong> Check corners, shower screens, under sinks</li>
                <li><strong>Toilet flush:</strong> Does it flush properly and refill?</li>
                <li><strong>Tap function:</strong> All taps work without dripping?</li>
                <li><strong>Shower pressure:</strong> Turn it on — is pressure adequate?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Old bathroom silicone is almost universal in Byron Bay properties over 5 years old. It's not just cosmetic — failed silicone causes water damage behind tiles and under floors.</p>

            <p>Re-siliconing a bathroom: $220-$350.</p>

            <h2>Flyscreens: Essential in Byron's Climate</h2>

            <p>Flyscreens aren't optional in Byron Bay — they're essential. Summer without flyscreens means you're getting eaten alive by mosquitoes and midges.</p>

            <p>I check:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mesh condition:</strong> Torn, holey, or degraded from UV?</li>
                <li><strong>Screen door frames:</strong> Bent or damaged?</li>
                <li><strong>Closers and latches:</strong> Do screen doors actually close and latch?</li>
                <li><strong>Missing screens:</strong> Windows without screens at all</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I find damaged flyscreens on probably 70% of Byron Bay properties. Previous owners often remove damaged screens and never replace them.</p>

            <p>Flyscreen repairs: $80-$150 per screen.</p>

            <h2>Electrical: Safety and Functionality</h2>

            <p>I'm not an electrician, but I do basic safety checks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Test every light switch</strong> — do lights work?</li>
                <li><strong>Test power points</strong> — I use a plug-in tester</li>
                <li><strong>Look for exposed wiring or damaged outlets</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Check switchboard for old fuses</strong> (should be circuit breakers)</li>
                <li><strong>Test ceiling fans</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Anything concerning gets flagged for a licensed electrician to inspect. Electrical safety isn't something to DIY.</p>

            <h2>Hot Water: Does It Actually Work?</h2>

            <p>Building inspectors note if a hot water system exists. I test if it works:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Turn on hot taps and time how long it takes to get hot</li>
                <li>Check water temperature — is it actually hot or just warm?</li>
                <li>Look for leaks around the system</li>
                <li>Note the age (check the date stamp on the unit)</li>
                <li>Check for rust or corrosion</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Hot water systems over 10 years old are on borrowed time. If yours is 12-15 years old, budget for replacement soon (even if it's currently working).</p>

            <p>New hot water system: $1,200-$2,500 installed.</p>

            <h2>Under the House: The Forgotten Area</h2>

            <p>If the property has an accessible under-house area, I crawl under with a torch:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standing water:</strong> Indicates drainage problems</li>
                <li><strong>Damp areas:</strong> Can cause mold and structural issues</li>
                <li><strong>Timber condition:</strong> Check bearers and floor joists for rot</li>
                <li><strong>Termite activity:</strong> Mud tunnels on timber or stumps</li>
                <li><strong>Rubbish accumulation:</strong> Previous owners sometimes dump stuff under houses</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Under-house problems are expensive if left unchecked. Finding them early saves thousands.</p>

            <h2>Gutters: The Silent Damage Causers</h2>

            <p>I don't climb on roofs (that's for professionals with insurance), but I check gutters from ground level and with a ladder if safe:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Look for visible leaf buildup</li>
                <li>Check downpipes for blockages</li>
                <li>Look for sagging gutter sections</li>
                <li>Note rust holes or damage</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Blocked gutters cause water damage to fascia, ceilings, and walls. They're also fire hazards in dry months.</p>

            <p>Gutter cleaning: $180-$280 for a standard Byron Bay property.</p>

            <h2>Walls and Ceilings: Water Damage Detective Work</h2>

            <p>I look at every wall and ceiling for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water stains:</strong> Brown marks indicate current or past leaks</li>
                <li><strong>Soft spots:</strong> Press on suspicious areas — soft means water damage</li>
                <li><strong>Cracks:</strong> Structural movement or settling</li>
                <li><strong>Mold:</strong> Black spots or patches in corners</li>
                <li><strong>Paint condition:</strong> Peeling or bubbling indicates moisture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Water damage in Byron Bay accelerates quickly due to humidity. A small ceiling leak becomes major damage within months if not addressed.</p>

            <h2>The Photo Report I Provide</h2>

            <p>After the inspection (usually 90 minutes for a standard 3-bedroom property), I send:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>100-150 photos</strong> showing every area and any issues found</li>
                <li><strong>Video walk-through</strong> (if requested)</li>
                <li><strong>Written report</strong> in three sections:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Urgent (fix before move-in)</li>
                        <li>Important (fix in first month)</li>
                        <li>Can wait (cosmetic or minor)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cost estimates</strong> for each repair</li>
                <li><strong>Recommended timeline</strong> for completing work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This gives interstate owners everything they need to make informed decisions about what work to organize before moving in.</p>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h3>Byron Bay Property Inspection Checklist</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>✓ Decks and outdoor timber (boards, railings, substructure)</li>
                    <li>✓ All doors and windows (operation, locks, seals)</li>
                    <li>✓ Kitchen cupboards and appliances</li>
                    <li>✓ Bathrooms (silicone, grouting, fixtures)</li>
                    <li>✓ Flyscreens (condition, functionality)</li>
                    <li>✓ Electrical (lights, power points, safety)</li>
                    <li>✓ Hot water system (function, age, condition)</li>
                    <li>✓ Under-house area (moisture, timber, termites)</li>
                    <li>✓ Gutters and drainage</li>
                    <li>✓ Walls and ceilings (water damage, cracks, mold)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>What This Inspection Costs and Why It's Worth It</h2>

            <p>Pre-move inspection for a newly bought Byron Bay property: $120-$250 depending on size and complexity.</p>

            <p>Why it's worth it:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Identifies problems before you move in (easier to fix when empty)</li>
                <li>Prevents surprises (you know what you're arriving to)</li>
                <li>Helps prioritize repairs (urgent vs can wait)</li>
                <li>Provides cost estimates (budget properly)</li>
                <li>Gives peace of mind (especially for sight-unseen buyers)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Last month I inspected a Mullumbimby property for a Sydney buyer. Building inspection said "structurally sound, minor maintenance required." My inspection found: deck substructure rotting ($3,200 to fix), hot water system 16 years old and likely to fail soon ($1,800 replacement), and significant bathroom water damage behind tiles ($2,400 repair).</p>

            <p>Total unexpected costs: $7,400. They appreciated knowing before moving in so they could budget and organize repairs while the property was still empty.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay and Northern Rivers properties are beautiful, but coastal environments are tough on buildings. A thorough pre-move inspection tells you exactly what you've bought and what needs attention before you arrive with your belongings.</p>

            <p>If you've just bought in Byron Bay, Bangalow, Mullumbimby, Ballina, Lennox Head, or anywhere in the Northern Rivers and need a comprehensive pre-move inspection, send me the address. I'll walk through it, document everything, and send you a detailed photo report with cost estimates and priorities so you can make smart decisions about your new property.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">What's the difference between a building inspection and your pre-move inspection?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Building inspections focus on structural issues and major defects affecting property value. My pre-move inspections focus on livability—will everything work when you move in? Do doors close, taps work, deck is safe? Practical stuff building inspectors don't check.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">Do you climb on the roof during inspections?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">No, that requires specific insurance and qualifications. I check roofs from ground level and with a ladder where safe. For detailed roof inspections, I recommend licensed roof inspectors.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">How long does a comprehensive property inspection take?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">About 90 minutes for a standard 3-bedroom Byron Bay property. Larger properties or those with extensive issues take longer. I'm thorough—I check everything that affects whether the property is genuinely move-in ready.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">Can you provide the inspection report in a specific format?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">I provide photos (100-150 typically), written report in three priority sections (urgent, important, can wait), cost estimates for each repair, and recommended timeline. If you need a specific format, let me know.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">If it's before settlement, you might have legal options depending on vendor disclosure. If it's after settlement, budget for repairs and prioritize by urgency. I provide clear cost estimates so you can make informed decisions.</p>
