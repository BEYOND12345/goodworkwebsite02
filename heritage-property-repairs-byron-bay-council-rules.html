            <h1>Heritage Property Repairs Byron Bay - Council Rules You Need to Know</h1>

            <p>Got a heritage-listed property in Byron Bay? Or something in the Arts & Industry Estate, old Jonson Street area, Railway Park precinct? Then Byron Council has opinions about what you can and can't fix.</p>

            <p>I work on a lot of heritage properties around Byron. Weatherboard cottages from the 1920s, old timber workers cottages, Arts & Industry warehouses converted to homes. Love these old buildings - proper craftsmanship, wide boards, real hardwood.</p>

            <p>But council rules can be a pain. Here's what you actually need approval for and what you don't.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ Important: I'm Not a Town Planner</h3>
                <p>This is practical advice based on working on Byron heritage properties for years. But for your specific property, check Byron Council's heritage advisor or get a town planner. Fines for unapproved heritage work start at Contact for quote and go up from there.</p>
                <p>Byron Council heritage hotline: (02) 6626 7000</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Where Are Byron's Heritage Areas?</h2>

            <p>Not every old building in Byron is heritage-listed. But certain areas have heritage overlays - means council watches what you do:</p>

            <h3>Strict Heritage Controls:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arts & Industry Estate:</strong> Whole area. Old piggery, industrial buildings, warehouses. Heaps of restrictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Jonson Street commercial heritage:</strong> Main street buildings, especially older shopfronts.</li>
                <li><strong>Railway Park precinct:</strong> Workers cottages, railway station area.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual heritage items:</strong> Specific listed buildings (lighthouse, beach hotel, some old homes).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>General Heritage Character Areas:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parts of Byron town:</strong> Older residential streets with character housing.</li>
                <li><strong>Some Bangalow properties:</strong> Village heritage cottages.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Check if your property has heritage listing: Byron Council website > Property info > Enter your address. Shows if you've got heritage overlay, conservation area, or individual listing.</p>

            <h2>What You Can Do WITHOUT Council Approval</h2>

            <p>This is "exempt development" or maintenance work. Council doesn't care, just do it:</p>

            <h3>Internal Repairs (Generally Fine):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix broken cupboard doors and drawers</li>
                <li>Replace kitchen hinges and handles</li>
                <li>Repair internal timber flooring (like-for-like)</li>
                <li>Fix cracks in internal walls</li>
                <li>Paint internal walls (any color you want)</li>
                <li>Replace internal doors if same style/size</li>
                <li>Fix broken stairs/handrails (if matching existing)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>External Maintenance (As Long As It's Exact Replacement):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Re-paint exterior in existing colors</li>
                <li>Replace rotten weatherboards with matching timber</li>
                <li>Fix broken roof tiles/iron (same style and color)</li>
                <li>Clean and repair gutters</li>
                <li>Replace broken window panes (keep same frame and style)</li>
                <li>Fix deck boards (like-for-like replacement)</li>
                <li>Repair existing fences (same height and style)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Key phrase: <strong>"Like-for-like replacement."</strong> If you're replacing rotten weatherboards with the same timber species, same profile, painted the same color - that's maintenance. Council doesn't care.</p>

            <h2>What Needs Council Approval (Development Application)</h2>

            <p>Change anything visible from the street or structurally significant - you need approval:</p>

            <h3>Definitely Need Approval:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Change exterior paint colors</li>
                <li>Replace weatherboards with different material (eg timber to fibre cement)</li>
                <li>Add new windows or doors</li>
                <li>Move or remove windows/doors</li>
                <li>Change roof material or color</li>
                <li>Build new structures (deck, carport, shed)</li>
                <li>Extend the building</li>
                <li>Install solar panels (yes, really - on heritage buildings)</li>
                <li>Change front fence height or style</li>
                <li>Remove or significantly prune large trees</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grey Area (Check First):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Replace timber with different species (eg replace hardwood with pine)</li>
                <li>Add insulation to walls (if it changes exterior appearance)</li>
                <li>Install aircon units visible from street</li>
                <li>Change window sizes (even slightly)</li>
                <li>Repair extensive rot damage if it changes structure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For grey area stuff - call Byron Council heritage team before starting. Takes 10 minutes, saves thousands in fines.</p>

            <h2>Arts & Industry Estate - Extra Restrictions</h2>

            <p>Arts & Industry's a special pain because it's State Heritage listed, not just local. Means stricter rules:</p>

            <p><strong>Can't do without approval:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Change any exterior materials</li>
                <li>Paint different colors (even slight shade changes)</li>
                <li>Modify windows or doors at all</li>
                <li>Add solar panels (almost always rejected)</li>
                <li>Build anything new (sheds, carports, etc)</li>
                <li>Change rooflines or add skylights</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I've worked on several Arts & Industry properties. Every single change needs approval. Budget 3-6 months for DA approval, costs Contact for quote-5,000 in planning/heritage consultant fees.</p>

            <p>The industrial aesthetic is protected - can't really modernize the exterior much at all. Interiors more flexible, but structural changes still need approval.</p>

            <h2>What Council Actually Cares About</h2>

            <p>From doing this for years, here's what Byron Council heritage team focuses on:</p>

            <h3>Street-Facing Appearance</h3>
            <p>Can you see it from the street? Council cares. Can't see it from the street? They care way less.</p>

            <p>Rear deck rebuild - usually fine. Front verandah changes - need approval.</p>

            <h3>Original Materials and Character</h3>
            <p>Keep old timber weatherboards as timber. Don't replace with Hardie board or vinyl - gets rejected every time.</p>

            <p>Original hardwood floorboards - keep them. Replace rotten ones with matching timber.</p>

            <h3>Paint Colors</h3>
            <p>Heritage paint schemes are protected. Can't paint your Jonson Street heritage cottage hot pink. Council has approved color palettes - heritage whites, creams, federation colors.</p>

            <p>Want to change colors? Submit color samples with DA. They'll approve or reject based on historical accuracy.</p>

            <h2>The Reality of Heritage Repairs in Byron Bay</h2>

            <p>Here's what actually happens:</p>

            <p><strong>Scenario 1: Like-for-Like Maintenance</strong></p>
            <p>Your weatherboards are rotten. You replace them with matching timber, same profile, paint the same color. No council approval needed. This is maintenance.</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-280 per board including labor and paint.</p>

            <p><strong>Scenario 2: Coastal Rot is Extensive</strong></p>
            <p>Whole wall of weatherboards rotted from salt air (common in Byron beachside heritage). Need to replace 30+ boards. Technically maintenance if like-for-like, but this much work - I'd notify council just to cover yourself.</p>

            <p>Email Byron Council: "Replacing extensive rotten weatherboards on heritage property with matching timber. Is notification required?" Usually they say no, but you've got it in writing.</p>

            <p><strong>Scenario 3: Want to Change Something</strong></p>
            <p>Want to add a rear deck, change window size, add insulation that changes wall thickness. This needs full DA.</p>

            <p>Process: Hire heritage consultant (Contact for quote-3,000), prepare Statement of Heritage Impact, submit DA (Contact for quote-1,200), wait 3-6 months, probably need to negotiate changes, eventually get approval (maybe).</p>

            <p>Total cost before any actual work: Contact for quote-6,000.</p>

            <h2>Common Heritage Repairs and Council Rules</h2>

            <h3>Rotten Weatherboards</h3>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Byron's coastal humidity rots timber fast. Weatherboards go soft, paint peels, water gets behind them.</p>

            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Replace with matching timber - same species if possible (Oregon, hardwood, whatever's original). Same width, same profile.</p>

            <p><strong>Council approval?</strong> No, if exact match. Maybe if replacing with different species - check first.</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-280 per board. Arts & Industry Estate properties - source matching timber first (harder to find, costs more).</p>

            <h3>Rotten Deck Timber</h3>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Old deck boards rotting, posts going soft, bearers deteriorating.</p>

            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Replace rotten sections with treated hardwood. Keep same deck size and height.</p>

            <p><strong>Council approval?</strong> Repairs = no approval needed. Extending deck or changing height = needs approval.</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-50/sqm for board replacement. Full deck rebuild Contact for quote-280/sqm depending on timber spec.</p>

            <h3>Window Repairs</h3>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Old timber sash windows rotting at the sill, sashes won't open, glass cracked.</p>

            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Repair rotten timber, re-putty glass, adjust sashes. Keep original windows - don't replace with aluminum.</p>

            <p><strong>Council approval?</strong> Repairs = no. Replacement = yes (and they prefer you keep originals).</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-400 per window to repair properly. Way cheaper than replacement and council-friendly.</p>

            <h3>Roof Repairs</h3>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Corrugated iron roof rusting through, tiles cracked from hail.</p>

            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Replace damaged sections with matching material. Keep same profile and color.</p>

            <p><strong>Council approval?</strong> Like-for-like = no. Change material or color = yes.</p>

            <p>Cost: Contact for quote-2,500 for typical heritage roof repairs.</p>

            <h2>Timber Species for Heritage Repairs</h2>

            <p>Original Byron heritage buildings used whatever was local and available. Match it as close as possible:</p>

            <p><strong>Original timber (1900s-1940s):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oregon (weatherboards, joinery) - hard to source now, expensive</li>
                <li>Hardwood (flooring, structure) - various species</li>
                <li>Cedar (some weatherboards, internal lining)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Modern replacement options:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If original was Oregon:</strong> Use Oregon if you can find it, or treated pine milled to match profile. Council sometimes accepts this.</li>
                <li><strong>If original was hardwood:</strong> Use spotted gum, blackbutt, or similar hardwood. Must be H3/H4 treated for coastal Byron.</li>
                <li><strong>If original was cedar:</strong> Cedar's available but expensive. Western red cedar is substitute.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Don't use: Fiber cement (Hardie board), vinyl, composite materials. Gets rejected on heritage properties every time.</p>

            <h2>Paint Colors on Heritage Properties</h2>

            <p>Byron Council has heritage color schemes. Generally they want:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Federation colors (1900s-1920s): Creams, soft greens, terracotta, heritage reds</li>
                <li>Inter-war colors (1920s-1940s): Whites, creams, soft pastels</li>
                <li>Industrial buildings: Original paint colors if known, or neutral tones</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Repainting in existing color = no approval needed.</p>

            <p>Changing color = need approval. Council wants to see color samples and heritage justification.</p>

            <h2>What Happens If You Don't Get Approval?</h2>

            <p>Byron Council's pretty onto unauthorized heritage work. Neighbors complain, inspectors drive past, someone reports it.</p>

            <p><strong>Consequences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stop work order (Contact for quote+ fine just for that)</li>
                <li>Forced to undo unauthorized work (your expense)</li>
                <li>Fines up to Contact for quote for serious heritage damage</li>
                <li>Retrospective DA required (harder to get approved, costs more)</li>
                <li>Property sale issues (unauthorized work shows up on Section 10.7 certificates)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Seen this twice in Byron - owners replaced weatherboards with Hardie board without approval. Council made them rip it all off and replace with timber. Cost them Contact for quote+ to fix.</p>

            <p>Just get approval if you need it. Cheaper than doing it twice.</p>

            <h2>Working With Byron Council Heritage Team</h2>

            <p>Byron Council heritage advisors are actually pretty helpful if you approach them properly:</p>

            <p><strong>Do this:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Call before starting work</li>
                <li>Explain what you want to do and why</li>
                <li>Ask if approval needed</li>
                <li>Get their advice in writing (email)</li>
                <li>Use materials they recommend</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Don't do this:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start work then ask for approval later</li>
                <li>Try to "get away with it"</li>
                <li>Argue that rules don't apply to you</li>
                <li>Use cheap substitutes for heritage materials</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They want heritage buildings preserved properly. If you're maintaining them well with appropriate materials, they're usually supportive.</p>

            <h2>Cost Reality Check</h2>

            <p>Heritage repairs cost more than standard work. Why?</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Materials harder to source (matching timber profiles, heritage paint)</li>
                <li>More labor (old buildings aren't square, nothing's standard size)</li>
                <li>Craftsmanship required (need to match original style)</li>
                <li>Council compliance (DA fees, heritage consultant, delays)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Budget 20-40% more for heritage repairs vs standard work. Arts & Industry Estate - budget even more.</p>

            <p>But these buildings are built better than modern houses. Proper maintenance and they last another 100 years.</p>
