        'content': '''<p>You've got tenants moving into your Byron Bay property in three weeks. The previous tenants just moved out, and you need to know: how much is this going to cost to get it rent-ready? Every landlord and property manager in Byron Bay asks me this question. The answer depends on the property's condition, but I can give you realistic numbers based on dozens of rental turnarounds I've done across Byron Bay and the Northern Rivers.</p>

<p>Here's a complete cost breakdown for getting a Byron Bay property tenant-ready, plus what affects those costs and where you can save money without cutting corners.</p>

<h2>Basic Rent-Ready Turnaround: $850-$1,500</h2>

<p>For a standard 3-bedroom Byron Bay rental in reasonable condition (no major damage, just normal wear and tear between tenants), here's what a basic turnaround costs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Professional clean:</strong> $350-$500</li>
<li><strong>Minor repairs (door adjustments, handle replacements, touch-up painting):</strong> $200-$400</li>
<li><strong>Garden tidy and lawn mowing:</strong> $150-$250</li>
<li><strong>Gutter cleaning:</strong> $180-$280</li>
<li><strong>Carpet steam clean (if applicable):</strong> $150-$250</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total: $1,030-$1,680</strong></p>

<p>This assumes the property doesn't need repainting, major repairs, or significant renovation work. It's the cost to take a property from "previous tenants just left" to "new tenants can move in tomorrow."</p>

<h2>Mid-Range Turnaround: $2,500-$5,000</h2>

<p>If the property needs more work — some rooms need repainting, deck maintenance, fly screen repairs, or moderate wear and tear fixes — you're looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Everything from basic turnaround:</strong> $1,030-$1,680</li>
<li><strong>Repaint 2-3 rooms:</strong> $1,200-$2,400</li>
<li><strong>Deck clean and re-oil:</strong> $600-$1,200</li>
<li><strong>Fly screen repairs (3-4 screens):</strong> $240-$600</li>
<li><strong>Kitchen cupboard repairs and adjustments:</strong> $180-$350</li>
<li><strong>Bathroom re-siliconing:</strong> $220-$350</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total: $3,470-$6,580</strong></p>

<p>This level is common for Byron Bay properties that have had tenants for 2-3 years. Normal coastal wear and tear adds up — decks fade, paint marks accumulate, cupboards need attention.</p>

<h2>Extensive Turnaround: $6,000-$12,000+</h2>

<p>If your rental needs significant work before it's tenant-ready, costs escalate:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full interior repaint (3-bedroom):</strong> $3,500-$6,000</li>
<li><strong>Deck restoration (sanding, board replacement, re-oiling):</strong> $2,000-$5,000</li>
<li><strong>Fence repairs or replacement:</strong> $800-$3,000</li>
<li><strong>Kitchen or bathroom renovation:</strong> $3,000-$15,000</li>
<li><strong>Flooring replacement:</strong> $2,000-$8,000</li>
</ul>

<p>These costs apply when properties have been neglected, had problem tenants, or need upgrading to meet current rental market expectations in Byron Bay.</p>

<h2>What Affects Rental Prep Costs in Byron Bay?</h2>

<p><strong>Coastal Location:</strong> Properties close to the beach (Belongil, Suffolk Park, Wategos) need more frequent deck maintenance and exterior work due to salt air. This adds $500-$1,500 per turnaround compared to hinterland properties.</p>

<p><strong>Property Age:</strong> Older Byron Bay homes need more maintenance. Timber windows, weatherboard cladding, and aging infrastructure mean higher turnaround costs.</p>

<p><strong>Tenant Length:</strong> Short-term tenancies (6-12 months) usually need less work. Long-term tenancies (3+ years) often need repainting and more substantial maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Rental Market Expectations:</strong> Byron Bay's competitive rental market means properties need to be well-presented. Budget for quality finishes, not just "good enough."</p>

<h2>Where Landlords Can Save Money</h2>

<p>Smart ways to reduce turnaround costs without compromising quality:</p>

<p><strong>Preventative Maintenance:</strong> Annual gutter cleaning, deck oiling, and minor repairs during tenancy prevent expensive emergency work between tenants. $500/year in maintenance saves $2,000 in turnaround costs.</p>

<p><strong>Good Tenant Selection:</strong> Tenants who care for the property reduce damage. Work with property managers who screen properly.</p>

<p><strong>Keep Matched Paint:</strong> Store leftover paint from each room. Touch-ups cost $50-$150 vs $600-$1,000 to repaint entire rooms.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Quarterly property inspections catch small issues before they become expensive problems.</p>

<p><strong>Bundle Work:</strong> If you have multiple rentals, coordinate maintenance. Tradies often discount when doing several properties in one area.</p>

<h2>Costs Specific to Byron Bay Rentals</h2>

<p>Byron Bay has unique costs compared to other rental markets:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deck Maintenance:</strong> Almost every Byron Bay rental has a timber deck. Budget $600-$1,200 per turnaround for deck work.</li>
<li><strong>Mold Treatment:</strong> Byron's humidity breeds mold. Professional treatment costs $150-$400 per property.</li>
<li><strong>Garden Maintenance:</strong> Byron Bay tenants expect outdoor areas. Overgrown gardens reduce rental appeal. Budget $200-$500 for garden restoration.</li>
<li><strong>Fly Screens:</strong> Essential in Byron's climate. Worn screens need replacing regularly — $80-$150 each.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Property Managers Actually Charge</h2>

<p>Most Byron Bay property managers charge landlords for coordination of maintenance. Typical fees:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arranging quotes:</strong> Often free or included in management fee</li>
<li><strong>Supervision of work:</strong> 10-15% of job cost</li>
<li><strong>Emergency callouts:</strong> $80-$150 per callout</li>
</ul>

<p>Working directly with trades (like me) removes this markup. However, property managers provide value through tenant coordination and documentation.</p>

<h2>Real Examples from Byron Bay Rentals</h2>

<p>Last month I worked on three Byron Bay rental turnarounds:</p>

<p><strong>Suffolk Park 2-bedroom unit:</strong> Clean condition after 18-month tenancy. Professional clean ($380), minor door adjustments ($120), garden tidy ($180). Total: $680.</p>

<p><strong>Byron Bay 3-bedroom house:</strong> 3-year tenancy, moderate wear. Clean ($450), repaint 2 rooms ($1,600), deck re-oil ($800), gutter clean ($220), fly screen repairs ($320). Total: $3,390.</p>

<p><strong>Bangalow 4-bedroom cottage:</strong> Neglected property, new landlord upgrading for better rental return. Full interior repaint ($5,200), deck restoration ($3,800), bathroom re-grout and paint ($1,200), garden overhaul ($900), deep clean ($550). Total: $11,650.</p>

<p>The Bangalow property was extreme, but the landlord increased rent from $550/week to $750/week after the work. The investment paid off in 8 months.</p>

<p>Whether you're spending $1,000 or $10,000, the key is getting your Byron Bay rental properly presented. Well-maintained properties rent faster, command higher rent, and attract better tenants. Cutting corners to save $500 often costs you weeks of vacancy, which is far more expensive.</p>

<p>If you need a realistic quote for getting your Byron Bay rental property tenant-ready, send me photos and a description. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of what needs doing and what it'll cost. Most property managers and landlords in the Northern Rivers have my number for exactly this.</p>'''

        'content': '''<p>You bought a Byron Bay property without physically seeing it. Maybe you made the decision from interstate based on photos and a virtual tour. Or you were in Byron for one day, did a quick walk-through, and made an offer. Now settlement's approaching and you're wondering: what have I actually bought? Is it safe? Is it move-in ready?</p>

<p>I work with sight-unseen buyers constantly in Byron Bay. The property market moves fast here, and interstate buyers often can't get to Byron multiple times before settlement. Here's how to make sure your property is safe and ready before you arrive with the moving truck — even if you haven't physically been inside it since the building inspection.</p>

<h2>Get a Professional Pre-Move Inspection</h2>

<p>Different from the building inspection you got before settlement, a pre-move inspection focuses on livability and safety. I walk through the property looking for anything that affects whether you can safely live there immediately.</p>

<p>What I check:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>All doors and windows lock securely</strong> — security is critical when moving into an empty property</li>
<li><strong>Electrical safety</strong> — no sparking switches, exposed wiring, or broken power points</li>
<li><strong>Hot water works</strong> — not just "exists," but actually heats water quickly and consistently</li>
<li><strong>Structural safety</strong> — deck stability, stair railings are secure, no obvious hazards</li>
<li><strong>Water leaks</strong> — active leaks that could cause damage or make rooms unusable</li>
<li><strong>Mold or moisture issues</strong> — anything affecting air quality or health</li>
</ul>

<p>I send you a photo report showing everything, with a prioritized list: what's urgent (fix before you arrive), what's important (fix in the first month), and what can wait.</p>

<p>Cost for this service: $120-$250 depending on property size. Worth every dollar when you're buying sight-unseen.</p>

<h2>Check Security Before You Arrive</h2>

<p>Empty properties attract attention. Before you move in, verify:</p>

<ul>
<li>All external doors have working deadlocks</li>
<li>Windows can be securely locked</li>
<li>There are no easy access points (broken windows, unlocked sliding doors, gaps in fencing)</li>
<li>Shed or garage locks work</li>
<li>Gates can be secured</li>
</ul>

<p>I regularly find properties where locks are broken, keys don't work, or security is compromised. Fixing this before arrival is essential — you don't want to arrive late on a Friday afternoon to find you can't secure the property overnight.</p>

<p>Lock repairs and key cutting: $80-$200 typically fixes most security issues.</p>

<h2>Verify Essential Services Work</h2>

<p>Building inspectors check if things exist, not if they work properly. Before move-in, test:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hot water system:</strong> Does it heat quickly? Is it sized appropriately for the house?</li>
<li><strong>Oven and cooktop:</strong> Do all elements work?</li>
<li><strong>Lights and power:</strong> Test every switch and power point</li>
<li><strong>Toilets:</strong> Do they flush properly and refill?</li>
<li><strong>Taps:</strong> Do they all work without leaking?</li>
<li><strong>Ceiling fans:</strong> Are they functional and safe?</li>
</ul>

<p>I test everything and send video evidence. You see exactly what works and what needs attention.</p>

<h2>Look for Water Damage the Inspector Missed</h2>

<p>Building inspectors can miss subtle water damage, especially if they inspected during dry weather. I check:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Under sinks</strong> for water stains or active leaks</li>
<li><strong>Bathroom ceilings</strong> for discoloration or soft spots</li>
<li><strong>Around windows</strong> for moisture damage to frames or sills</li>
<li><strong>Under the house</strong> for standing water or damp areas</li>
<li><strong>Roof cavity</strong> (if accessible) for leaks or damage</li>
</ul>

<p>Water damage in Byron Bay's humid climate accelerates quickly. A small leak becomes a major problem if left unaddressed.</p>

<h2>Check Outdoor Safety Hazards</h2>

<p>Decks, stairs, and railings are major safety concerns in Byron Bay properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walk on every deck board — feel for soft spots indicating rot</li>
<li>Test deck railings — they should be solid, not wobbly</li>
<li>Check stair stability — loose or rotted stairs are dangerous</li>
<li>Look at retaining walls for cracks or movement</li>
<li>Check fencing for safety (especially if you have kids or pets)</li>
</ul>

<p>I've walked onto Byron Bay decks that looked fine in photos but were dangerous in person — rotted substructure, wobbly railings, loose boards. These are urgent safety fixes before move-in.</p>

<h2>Verify the Property Is Actually Clean</h2>

<p>Most contracts include an "exit clean" from the previous owner. But standards vary wildly. I've seen "cleaned" Byron Bay properties where:</p>

<ul>
<li>The oven is filthy</li>
<li>Bathrooms have soap scum and mold</li>
<li>Windows are dirty</li>
<li>Cupboards have old food or grime</li>
<li>Carpets are stained</li>
</ul>

<p>If cleaning wasn't done properly, it's harder to enforce after settlement. Get someone local to check before settlement if possible, or be prepared to organize professional cleaning immediately after.</p>

<p>Professional clean for a 3-bedroom Byron Bay house: $350-$500.</p>

<h2>Document Everything with Photos</h2>

<p>When buying sight-unseen, photo documentation is critical. I provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Photos of every room from multiple angles</li>
<li>Close-ups of any damage or issues</li>
<li>Video walk-through of the entire property</li>
<li>Detailed written report describing condition</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates a record of the property's condition on settlement, useful for insurance claims, disputes, or just understanding what you've bought.</p>

<h2>What Sight-Unseen Buyers Commonly Miss</h2>

<p>Based on dozens of sight-unseen purchases I've helped with in Byron Bay:</p>

<p><strong>Noise:</strong> Photos don't show noise. Is the property next to a busy road? Close to bars or venues? Neighbors with loud dogs? Visit if possible, or ask a local to assess.</p>

<p><strong>Smells:</strong> Mold, damp, or smoke damage creates odors that photos don't capture. A local inspection identifies these.</p>

<p><strong>Condition of fixtures:</strong> Cupboards, handles, fixtures might look fine in photos but be broken or loose in person.</p>

<p><strong>Deck condition:</strong> Decks photograph well but can be completely rotted underneath.</p>

<p><strong>Street appeal:</strong> The property might look great, but is the street rough? Is the garden overgrown? First impressions matter.</p>

<h2>What to Do If You Find Problems</h2>

<p>If the pre-move inspection reveals serious issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Before settlement:</strong> You might have grounds to renegotiate or delay settlement if issues weren't disclosed</li>
<li><strong>After settlement:</strong> Budget for urgent repairs and prioritize based on safety and livability</li>
</ul>

<p>Most sight-unseen Byron Bay buyers find minor to moderate issues — things that need fixing but aren't deal-breakers. Budget $2,000-$5,000 for unexpected repairs when buying sight-unseen. Better to have it budgeted and not need it than be caught short.</p>

<h2>Creating a Safe Move-In Plan</h2>

<p>For sight-unseen buyers, I recommend this timeline:</p>

<p><strong>2 weeks before settlement:</strong> Pre-move inspection to identify issues</p>

<p><strong>1 week before settlement:</strong> Urgent repairs organized (security, safety hazards)</p>

<p><strong>Settlement week:</strong> Final checks, cleaning, utilities connected</p>

<p><strong>Move-in week:</strong> Non-urgent repairs, unpacking, settling in</p>

<p>This staged approach means you arrive to a property that's safe, secure, and livable — even if you haven't seen it in person since you made the offer months ago.</p>

<p>Buying sight-unseen in Byron Bay is increasingly common. The market moves too fast for multiple interstate visits. But you don't have to arrive blind. A thorough pre-move inspection by someone local who knows what to look for gives you confidence that your new Byron Bay property is safe, functional, and ready for you to move in.</p>

<p>If you've bought in Byron Bay or the Northern Rivers sight-unseen and want a comprehensive pre-move inspection, send me the address. I'll walk through it, test everything, document the condition, and send you a detailed report so you know exactly what you're arriving to.</p>'''
