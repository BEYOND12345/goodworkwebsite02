                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Coastal Humidity:</strong> 70-80% humidity levels cause timber and MDF doors to swell</li>

                                    <li><strong>Cheap Hardware:</strong> Even expensive kitchens often use inland-grade hardware</li>
                                    <li><strong>Seasonal Swelling:</strong> Problems worse December-March during humidity peaks</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Working on decks around Byron Bay, I've started to notice patterns in how the coastal conditions affect different types of timber and finishes. Last month I worked on a deck in Suffolk Park that looked fine from a distance, but up close you could see the salt air had done serious damage to the boards.</p>

                                <h3>Byron Bay's Salt Air Challenge</h3>
                                <p>The thing about living this close to the beach is that salt air gets into everything. I've seen decks in <a href="handyman-bangalow.html">Bangalow</a> (further inland) that look great after 5 years, while similar timber decks in <a href="handyman-byron-bay.html">Byron Bay</a> proper need attention after 2-3 years.</p>
                                
                                <p>Recently I worked on a <a href="deck-restoration.html">deck restoration in Byron Bay</a> where the homeowner was surprised their treated pine boards were showing wear so quickly. The reality is that treated pine near the coast needs more frequent maintenance than people expect.</p>

                                <h3>What I've Learned From Recent Jobs</h3>
                                <p>One challenging deck problem I encountered was in Lennox Head - the homeowner had used a budget deck oil that looked great initially but started peeling within 12 months of the salt exposure. We ended up having to sand it all back and start fresh with a marine-grade finish.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Timing matters:</strong> Best time for deck work is during the drier months (May to September)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Product quality:</strong> Cheap deck oils cost more in the long run near the coast</li>
                                    <li><strong>Preparation is everything:</strong> Proper cleaning and sanding makes the finish last twice as long</li>
                                    <li><strong>Regular maintenance:</strong> A quick oil every 18 months beats a full restoration every 5 years</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Real Cost Examples</h3>
                                <p>A customer in Bangalow recently asked about their deck boards, and here's what I quoted them:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Basic clean and oil (30m² deck): $450-550</li>
                                    <li>Sand back and re-oil (same size): $850-950</li>
                                    <li>Full board replacement: $180-220 per m²</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The Bangalow job ended up being the middle option - we sanded back the weathered areas and applied two coats of quality marine oil. Three months later it still looks great.</p>

                                <h3>When to Call vs DIY</h3>
                                <p>Honestly, if your deck just needs a clean and oil, and you're comfortable with a brush, you can probably handle it yourself. But if the timber is gray and weathered, or if boards are loose or damaged, that's when you want someone who knows what they're doing.</p>

                                <p>I always tell my customers - if you're not sure about the condition, give me a call for a quick look. Sometimes a deck that looks terrible just needs a proper clean, other times what looks okay actually needs serious attention.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Basic gutter inspection:</strong> Checking for loose brackets, holes, or damage</li>
                                    <li><strong>Clean-up:</strong> All debris bagged and taken away</li>
                                    <li><strong>Quick roof check:</strong> Looking for obvious issues while I'm up there</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Why Some Quotes Are Cheaper</h3>
                                <p>I've seen the aftermath of $120 gutter cleans in <a href="handyman-bangalow.html">Bangalow</a> where they basically just scooped out the big stuff and called it done. The homeowner ended up calling me six months later because their gutters were overflowing - the downpipes had never been properly cleared.</p>

                                <p>The reality is that proper gutter cleaning takes 2-3 hours on most homes when done right. If someone's quoting much less than $200, they're either cutting corners or undercharging (and probably won't be around long).</p>

                                <h3>When It Costs More</h3>
                                <p>Recently I worked on a property in Lennox Head where the price went up to $350 because:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Two-story home with complex roofline</li>
                                    <li>Gutters hadn't been cleaned in 3+ years</li>
                                    <li>Multiple downpipes were completely blocked</li>
                                    <li>Some gutter brackets needed tightening</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>I always give an honest quote upfront - if your place is going to take longer because of the condition or complexity, I'll let you know before I start.</p>

                                <h3>The Real Value</h3>
                                <p>One customer in Byron Bay taught me something about value. She said she'd rather pay $250 once a year and know it's done properly than pay $150 and worry about whether the job was thorough.</p>

                                <p>Since starting in Northern Rivers, I can tell you that blocked gutters cause more property damage than people realize. I've seen $5,000 in ceiling damage from a $20 worth of leaves that blocked a downpipe.</p>

                                <h3>When to Get Them Cleaned</h3>
                                <p>Best time is before storm season (October-November) and after the big autumn leaf drop (May-June). But honestly, if you can't remember the last time they were done, now's a good time.</p>

                            <h2 class="post-title">Unusual Emergency Handyman Calls Around Byron Bay</h2>
                            <p class="post-excerpt">In my time doing emergency handyman work around Northern Rivers, I've gotten some interesting calls. Here are the weird ones that taught me something.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="post-content">
                            <div class="post-text">
                                <p>In my time doing <a href="emergency-repairs.html">emergency handyman work</a> around Northern Rivers, I've gotten some interesting calls. Last week I got a call from a guy in <a href="handyman-bangalow.html">Bangalow</a> at 11pm because his bathroom door handle had completely fallen apart and his girlfriend was stuck inside the bathroom.</p>

                                <h3>The Midnight Door Handle Crisis</h3>
                                <p>Turns out the screws had gradually loosened over time (old house, lots of humidity), and the handle mechanism just gave up. The door was stuck shut with someone inside, and the external handle was in pieces on the floor.</p>

                                <p>Emergency call-out for something like this is $180, plus whatever the repair costs. In this case, I managed to get the door open by working the mechanism from outside, and fitted a new handle set for $85. Total cost: $265 at midnight on a Tuesday.</p>

                                <h3>Festival Season Emergencies</h3>
                                <p>Festival season in <a href="handyman-byron-bay.html">Byron Bay</a> means different types of emergency calls. I've had:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Toilet door locks breaking</strong> with a house full of guests</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deck railings coming loose</strong> (safety issue with parties)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Kitchen cupboard doors falling off</strong> hinges during big dinner prep</li>
                                    <li><strong>Outdoor lighting failing</strong> the day of a wedding</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>The Airbnb Kitchen Disaster</h3>
                                <p>One of the worst emergencies I've seen was in Suffolk Park - an Airbnb where the kitchen cabinet doors had all started sagging and wouldn't close properly. Guests were arriving in 4 hours and the host was panicking.</p>

                                <p>Problem was old hinges that had given up due to humidity and constant use. I keep spare cabinet hinges in the van now because it's such a common issue around here.</p>

                                <p>Fixed 8 cabinet doors in 3 hours for $320 emergency rate. The host said it saved their weekend bookings, so worth it for them.</p>

                                <h3>Coastal Weather Emergencies</h3>
                                <p>Living near the beach means weather-related calls:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Fence panels blown down</strong> (privacy emergency with neighbors)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gutters overflowing</strong> because downpipes blocked with debris</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deck boards lifting</strong> in strong winds</li>
                                    <li><strong>Salt corrosion causing door locks to fail</strong></li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>What Counts as a Real Emergency</h3>
                                <p>I always tell people - if it's a safety issue, can't wait until normal hours, or will cause property damage if left, then it's worth the emergency rate.</p>

                                <p>Recently I worked on an emergency in Ballina where water was dripping through the ceiling into the kitchen. Turned out to be a loose gutter bracket causing overflow, but if left overnight it would have damaged the ceiling plaster.</p>

                                <h3>Emergency Call-out Costs</h3>
                                <p>My standard emergency rates:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Evenings (6pm-10pm): $120 call-out plus materials/labor</li>
                                    <li>Late night (10pm-7am): $180 call-out plus materials/labor</li>
                                    <li>Weekends: $150 call-out plus materials/labor</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Most emergency jobs take 1-2 hours once I'm there, so total cost is usually $200-400 depending on what needs doing.</p>

                            <h2 class="post-title">Why Byron Bay Properties Are Different to Maintain</h2>
                            <p class="post-excerpt">If you live near the beach, you'll know that maintenance needs are different from inland properties. Here's what I've learned working around Byron Bay versus places like Lismore or Casino.</p>

                        <div class="post-content">

                                <p>If you live near the beach, you'll know that maintenance needs are different from inland properties. Working around Byron Bay versus places like Lismore or Casino, the difference is obvious within the first year of any installation or repair.</p>

                                <h3>Byron Bay's Salt Air Reality</h3>
                                <p>Byron Bay's salt air is brutal on anything metal. I've seen stainless steel door handles corrode within 2 years near the beach front. The same handles inland would last 10+ years easily.</p>

                                <p>Recently I worked on a deck in Byron Bay where all the galvanized screws had corroded and stained the timber. The deck was only 3 years old, but looked terrible because nobody had told the owner to use marine-grade fixings near the coast.</p>

                                <h3>What Works Better Near the Coast</h3>
                                <p>From the decks I've worked on around Byron Bay, here's what lasts:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Marine-grade stainless steel</strong> for all screws and brackets</li>
                                    <li><strong>Aluminium over steel</strong> wherever possible</li>
                                    <li><strong>Quality primer and paint systems</strong> - not the budget stuff</li>
                                    <li><strong>Regular washing</strong> to remove salt buildup</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>The Humidity Factor</h3>
                                <p>It's not just salt air - the humidity around Byron Bay causes different problems than I see inland. Timber swells and contracts more, paint doesn't cure as well, and things like hinges get sticky faster.</p>

                                <p>One customer in Suffolk Park taught me about this - their kitchen cabinet doors were constantly sticking. Turned out the humidity was making the timber swell just enough to bind in the frames. Had to plane them back and seal the edges properly.</p>

                                <h3>Seasonal Differences</h3>
                                <p>During the 2024 wet season, I noticed way more emergency calls from coastal properties than inland ones. The combination of salt air, humidity, and constant moisture causes accelerated wear on everything.</p>

                                <p>Hinterland properties around Bangalow and Mullumbimby have different challenges - more bushfire preparation, different pest issues, but much less corrosion and salt damage.</p>

                                <h3>What Coastal Properties Need More Often</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Gutter cleaning:</strong> Salt and sea spray creates more corrosive buildup</li>
                                    <li><strong>Door and window maintenance:</strong> Salt air gets into mechanisms</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deck maintenance:</strong> UV plus salt air is a harsh combination</li>
                                    <li><strong>Metal component replacement:</strong> Hinges, handles, brackets corrode faster</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Budget Reality for Coastal Homes</h3>
                                <p>I always tell coastal property owners to budget about 30% more for maintenance than they would inland. It's not that I charge more - it's that things need attention more often.</p>

                                <p>A deck that might need oiling every 3 years in Lismore will need it every 18 months in Byron Bay. Door handles that would last 8 years inland might need replacing after 4 years near the beach.</p>

                                <h3>The Upside</h3>
                                <p>On the positive side, coastal properties rarely have the pest issues you see inland, there's usually good drainage from the sea breeze, and problems are often obvious earlier because salt damage shows up clearly.</p>

                            <h2 class="post-title">Common Airbnb Maintenance Issues I Fix Around Byron Bay</h2>
                            <p class="post-excerpt">Working on holiday rental properties, there's a pattern to what breaks and when. Here's what I see most often and how to stay ahead of it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="post-content">
                            <div class="post-text">
                                <p>Working on holiday rental properties around Byron Bay and Bangalow, there's definitely a pattern to what breaks and when. Last week I got three separate calls for the same problem - kitchen cabinet doors that wouldn't close properly on different Airbnb properties.</p>

                                <h3>The Cabinet Door Problem</h3>
                                <p>Holiday rental properties get way more use than regular homes. Cabinet doors get opened and closed 20+ times per day with different guests who don't necessarily treat them gently.</p>

                                <p>I've come across this problem several times - the hinges start to sag, doors don't align properly, and eventually they won't close flush. Guests complain in reviews about "broken kitchen cupboards" even when they technically still work.</p>

                                <p>Quick fix is usually $15-25 per door to adjust or replace hinges. Much cheaper than negative reviews that cost bookings.</p>

                                <h3>Bathroom Door Locks That Stick</h3>
                                <p>Byron Bay's humidity plus constant use equals sticky door locks. I've had emergency calls where guests couldn't get out of bathrooms because the lock mechanism seized up.</p>

                                <p>One challenging lock problem I encountered was in Lennox Head where the ocean air had corroded the internal mechanism. Guest called the host at 2am, host called me at 6am. Had to drill out the lock and fit a new one before the next guests arrived.</p>

                                <p>Prevention: Check and lubricate bathroom door locks every 3 months, especially near the coast.</p>

                                <h3>What Breaks Most Often</h3>
                                <p>From my experience with holiday rentals:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Kitchen cabinet doors and drawers</strong> - hinges and slides wear out fast</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bathroom door handles and locks</strong> - humidity and constant use</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deck furniture and railings</strong> - guests are harder on outdoor furniture</li>
                                    <li><strong>Light switches and power points</strong> - get used way more than residential</li>
                                    <li><strong>Toilet seats and bathroom accessories</strong> - constant cleaning with strong products</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>The Between-Guests Rush</h3>
                                <p>The worst calls are when something breaks between checkout and checkin with only 4 hours to fix it. A customer in Byron Bay recently had their main bathroom door handle fall apart 2 hours before new guests arrived.</p>

                                <p>I keep common replacement parts in the van now: door handles, cabinet hinges, toilet seats, and basic electrical switches. Saves time when there's no time to waste.</p>

                                <h3>Preventive Maintenance Schedule</h3>
                                <p>Here's what I recommend for holiday rental properties:</p>

                                <p><strong>Monthly checks:</strong></p>
                                <ul>

                                <h3>Real Cost Examples</h3>
                                <p>Recent Airbnb maintenance jobs:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Kitchen cabinet door adjustment (6 doors): $120</li>
                                    <li>Emergency bathroom door handle replacement: $180 + $45 parts</li>
                                    <li>Deck railing tightening and safety check: $150</li>

                                </ul>

                                <h3>The Review Factor</h3>
                                <p>One thing I've learned from Airbnb hosts - a $30 repair can save a bad review that costs hundreds in lost bookings. Guests notice broken things and mention them in reviews, even minor stuff.</p>

                                <p>I always tell hosts - if something doesn't work smoothly, fix it before the next guests. "Good enough" for your own home isn't good enough for paying guests.</p>

                            <p class="post-excerpt">I've helped several homeowners get their Byron Bay properties ready for sale recently, and there's always panic about what needs fixing versus what can wait.</p>

                                <p>I've helped several homeowners get their Byron Bay properties ready for sale recently, and there's always panic about what needs fixing versus what can wait. Last month I worked with a couple in Suffolk Park who were stressed about a long list of "problems" their real estate agent had mentioned.</p>

                                <h3>What Real Estate Agents Actually Care About</h3>
                                <p>After working on a few pre-sale properties, I've started to understand what agents focus on versus what they mention just to cover themselves.</p>

                                <p>The Suffolk Park job taught me this - the agent's list had 15 items, but when I looked at them, only 5 actually mattered for the sale. Things like a loose deck board or sticky cabinet door can put buyers off, while a slightly faded fence doesn't really affect anything.</p>

                                <h3>First Impression Fixes That Matter</h3>
                                <p>Working on properties around Byron Bay, here's what actually impacts buyer perception:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Front door and entry:</strong> If the door handle is loose or the lock sticks, buyers notice immediately</li>
                                    <li><strong>Kitchen cabinet doors:</strong> If they don't close properly, it looks like the kitchen needs work</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bathroom door locks:</strong> Buyers always test bathroom locks - if they stick or don't work smoothly, it's a red flag</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deck safety:</strong> Any loose boards or wobbly railings make buyers worry about costs</li>
                                    <li><strong>Basic electrical:</strong> Light switches that don't work or power points that are loose suggest bigger problems</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>What Not to Waste Money On</h3>
                                <p>A client in Bangalow recently asked about painting their entire deck before sale. The deck was functional and safe, just looked a bit weathered. I told them honestly - save the $800, it won't add to the sale price.</p>

                                <p>Similarly, fixing cosmetic issues that buyers will likely change anyway (like old light fixtures or dated door handles) often isn't worth the expense unless they're actually broken.</p>

                                <h3>The 10-Minute Buyer Walk-Through Test</h3>
                                <p>Here's something I learned from a real estate agent in Byron Bay - buyers make up their minds in the first 10 minutes. They're looking for reasons to say no, not reasons to say yes.</p>

                                <p>So focus on things that will make them think "this place is well-maintained" rather than "I wonder what else is wrong here."</p>

                                <h3>Byron Bay Market Expectations</h3>
                                <p>Coastal properties have different standards. Buyers expect things to show some wear from salt air, but they want to see that it's been properly maintained.</p>

                                <p>Recently I worked on a property sale in Ocean Shores where we focused on:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Making sure all outdoor hardware was secure (salt air damage obvious)</li>
                                    <li>Checking deck boards weren't loose or splintered</li>
                                    <li>Ensuring all door and window locks worked smoothly</li>
                                    <li>Fixing any obvious water damage or staining</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Quick Fixes vs Big Projects</h3>
                                <p>Most pre-sale work I do is small stuff that makes a big difference:</p>

                                <p><strong>$50-150 fixes that help:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Tighten loose door handles and cabinet doors</li>
                                    <li>Replace sticky or broken locks</li>
                                    <li>Secure loose deck boards or railings</li>
                                    <li>Fix basic electrical issues</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>$500+ jobs that usually aren't worth it:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Full deck restoration (unless structural issues)</li>
                                    <li>Kitchen renovations (buyers often want their own style)</li>
                                    <li>Cosmetic painting (unless covering damage)</li>
                                    <li>New fixtures that work fine but look dated</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Timeline Planning</h3>
                                <p>Don't wait until the week before listing. I had a call from someone in Bangalow who wanted everything fixed in 3 days before their first open house. Some issues take time to source parts or need to dry/cure properly.</p>

                                <p>Give yourself at least 2 weeks to identify and fix issues properly.</p>
