## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Byron Bay - Kitchen Cabinet Repairs

**Sarah M. - Suffolk Park**
*Date: October 2024*

"Dan was an absolute lifesaver! Our kitchen cupboard doors wouldn't close properly - they'd been driving me crazy for months. Living so close to the beach, we needed someone who really understood how salt air and humidity affect timber.

Dan came out the same day I called, diagnosed the problem (warped doors and corroded hinges), and had everything fixed within 2 hours. He used marine-grade hinges that should last for years in our coastal environment.

Professional, friendly, and reasonably priced. Highly recommend for any Byron Bay residents!"

**Cost**: $180

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ballina - Emergency Storm Damage

**James T. - Ballina**
*Date: September 2024*

"Called Dan after the big storm last month damaged our pergola and fence. He came out within 3 hours - on a Sunday! - and made everything secure before more rain hit.

He came back the following week to do the proper repairs. Everything is solid now, and he even noticed some gutter damage I hadn't seen and sorted that too. Fair pricing, no hidden extras.

Having a handyman you can trust for emergencies is priceless. Dan's now my go-to for all property maintenance."

**Cost**: $350
**Response Time**: 3 hours (Sunday)

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lennox Head - Deck Restoration

**Michael & Lisa K. - Lennox Head**
*Date: August 2024*

"Our deck was in terrible shape - grey, splintery, embarrassing. We'd gotten quotes from others but Dan really knew his stuff about coastal decks.

He explained the whole process: sand, prep, marine-grade treatment, and oil. The transformation is incredible! Our 15-year-old deck looks brand new. Dan was meticulous about the work and cleaned up perfectly.

Three months later it still looks amazing. Worth every penny. If you have a coastal property, use someone who understands salt air damage - that's Dan."

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Byron Bay - Airbnb Turnaround

**Rachel P. - Byron Bay (Airbnb Host)**
*Date: October 2024*

"I manage 3 Airbnb properties in Byron Bay and Dan has been a game-changer. Fast, reliable, and understands the urgency of keeping properties guest-ready between bookings.

Last week a guest reported a sticking door at 8am checkout. Dan was there by noon and fixed it before the 3pm check-in. No lost booking, no stressed host!

He's my on-call handyman now. If you're an Airbnb host or property manager, you NEED someone like Dan on speed dial."

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Bangalow - General Handyman

**Trevor W. - Bangalow**
*Date: September 2024*

"Had a long list of small jobs that had been piling up - gutter cleaning, fixing fence palings, rehinging a gate, replacing some rotted fascia board.

Dan worked through everything methodically, didn't rush, and the quality is excellent. He even pointed out a couple of things I hadn't noticed (loose decking boards) and sorted those too at a fair price.

Old-school tradesman who takes pride in his work. Hard to find these days. Will definitely use again."

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mullumbimby - Gutter Cleaning

**Donna S. - Mullumbimby**
*Date: October 2024*

"With storm season coming, I needed gutters cleaned urgently. Dan fit me in within 2 days.

He cleaned all gutters, checked downpipes, cleared the valley gutters, and even took photos of some rust spots that need attention soon (not trying to upsell, just being helpful).

Professional service, fair price, and I know my gutters are ready for summer storms. Peace of mind!"

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Tweed Heads - Fence Installation

**Mark D. - Cabarita Beach**
*Date: July 2024*

"Needed a new colourbond fence installed. Dan gave me a detailed quote, explained all options, and helped me choose the right height and colour.

Installation was quick and professional. The fence is perfectly level and looks great. He even coordinated with my neighbour (shared fence) which saved me hassle.

Three months later, still perfect. Not even a mark from the salt air. Quality work!"

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ocean Shores - Kitchen Drawer Repairs

**Kate B. - Ocean Shores**
*Date: September 2024*

"All three of my kitchen drawers had stopped closing properly - the sliders were shot. Dan replaced them with heavy-duty soft-close sliders.

Now my drawers glide perfectly and close softly. Such a difference! He also tightened up a loose cupboard door hinge while he was there (no extra charge).

Great to deal with, reasonable pricing, quality work. Recommended!"

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lismore - Post-Flood Repairs

**Robert J. - Lismore**
*Date: August 2024*

"Still recovering from the floods. Dan helped repair water-damaged skirting boards and replace some rotted deck boards.

He understood the flood damage issues and was patient with insurance paperwork. Fair pricing during a difficult time, quality work, and actually showed up when he said he would (not common post-flood!).

If you're doing flood repairs in Lismore area, Dan gets it and does good work."
