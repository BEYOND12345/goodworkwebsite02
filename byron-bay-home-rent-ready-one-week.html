            <h1>How to Get Your Byron Bay Home Rent-Ready in One Week</h1>

            <p>You've got new tenants moving in next week and the property's not ready. Previous tenants just moved out, there's cleaning to do, minor repairs, touch-up painting, and you need it all done fast. This is a situation I handle constantly in Byron Bay — landlords and property managers needing a fast turnaround between tenants.</p>

            <p>One week is tight, but it's doable if you're organized and have someone local who can move quickly. I've prepped dozens of Byron Bay rental properties on this timeline. Here's exactly how to get your property rent-ready in seven days — even if you're managing it remotely from Brisbane or Sydney.</p>

            <h2>Day 1-2: Inspect and Create the Fix List</h2>

            <p>Don't start fixing things randomly. Day one is about walking through the property systematically and documenting everything that needs doing. Take photos, make notes, and create a prioritized list.</p>

            <p>Here's what I check on every Byron Bay rental property:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Walls for marks, scuffs, holes</li>
                <li>All doors and windows (operation, locks, screens)</li>
                <li>Kitchen cupboards and hinges</li>
                <li>Bathroom condition (silicone, grouting, cleanliness)</li>
                <li>Light fixtures and switches</li>
                <li>Flooring (carpet stains, damaged tiles, scratched timber)</li>
                <li>Outdoor areas (deck, garden, fencing)</li>
                <li>Gutters (quick visual check)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once you have the list, separate it into three categories: <strong>Must Fix</strong> (affects habitability or safety), <strong>Should Fix</strong> (cosmetic but important for first impression), and <strong>Can Wait</strong> (nice to have but not essential).</p>

            <p>In a one-week turnaround, you only do Must Fix and Should Fix. Can Wait items get scheduled for later.</p>

            <h2>Day 3-4: Repairs and Touch-Up Painting</h2>

            <p>Days three and four are for fixing everything on your Must Fix list plus as much of the Should Fix list as time allows.</p>

            <p>Common repairs on Byron Bay rental properties:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patch and paint walls:</strong> Fill holes from picture hooks, patch any damage, spot-paint to cover marks</li>
                <li><strong>Fix door and cupboard issues:</strong> Adjust hinges, plane swollen doors, tighten handles</li>
                <li><strong>Replace damaged fixtures:</strong> Broken light switches, cracked towel rails, loose toilet seats</li>
                <li><strong>Repair or replace damaged flyscreens</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fix minor plumbing issues:</strong> Dripping taps, loose shower heads, blocked drains</li>
                <li><strong>Test all appliances:</strong> Make sure oven, rangehood, dishwasher (if supplied) all work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Touch-up painting makes a massive difference. You're not repainting entire rooms (no time for that), but spot-painting marks and scuffs makes walls look fresh. Keep some paint matched to the property's interior — saves time on every turnover.</p>

            <p>I worked on a Suffolk Park rental last month — walls were marked up from furniture moves and kids' handprints. Two hours of touch-up painting with matched paint made the rooms look professionally presented. Cost the landlord $180, saved them from a $2,000 full repaint.</p>

            <h2>Day 5: Deep Clean</h2>

            <p>Day five is cleaning day. The property needs to be properly clean — not just tidy, but genuinely clean. New tenants notice everything in the first 24 hours.</p>

            <p>For a one-week turnaround, I recommend hiring professional cleaners. They're faster and more thorough than DIY. A professional clean for a 3-bedroom Byron Bay rental costs $350-$500.</p>

            <p>What should be included:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Oven and rangehood professionally cleaned</li>
                <li>Bathrooms scrubbed (tiles, shower screens, toilets, sinks)</li>
                <li>Kitchen benches, splashback, cupboards wiped</li>
                <li>All floors vacuumed and mopped</li>
                <li>Windows and sliding doors cleaned</li>
                <li>Light fixtures dusted</li>
                <li>Skirting boards wiped</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If the property has carpet, consider getting it steam cleaned. Costs $150-$250 and makes a big difference to how the place looks and smells.</p>

            <h2>Day 6: Final Checks and Garden Tidy</h2>

            <p>Day six is for final checks and outdoor presentation. Walk through the property again and make sure everything's working properly.</p>

            <p>Test:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>All lights and switches</li>
                <li>Hot water</li>
                <li>Oven and cooktop</li>
                <li>Locks on all doors and windows</li>
                <li>Toilet flushes properly</li>
                <li>Taps don't drip</li>
                <li>Screen doors close and latch</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Then tackle the garden and outdoor areas. Mow the lawn, whipper-snip edges, pull obvious weeds, sweep paths and the deck. If the garden's completely overgrown, hire a gardener for a one-off tidy — costs $150-$300 but worth it for first impression.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay tenants expect outdoor areas to be usable. A tidy garden and clean deck matter.</p>

            <h2>Day 7: Documentation and Handover</h2>

            <p>On day seven, the property should be ready. Do a final walk-through and document everything with photos. This becomes your condition report for the new tenancy.</p>

            <p>Take photos of:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Every room from multiple angles</li>
                <li>All appliances</li>
                <li>Walls, floors, ceiling (especially if there's any pre-existing marks or damage)</li>
                <li>Outdoor areas</li>
                <li>Any items you've noted as "acceptable wear and tear"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These photos protect you if there are disputes about condition at the end of the tenancy.</p>

            <p>Organize keys, garage remotes, any instruction manuals for appliances, and make sure everything's ready for the property manager or new tenants.</p>

            <h2>Working with Byron Bay Property Managers</h2>

            <p>I work with property managers across Byron Bay, Ballina, and Lennox Head on fast turnarounds. The key to making one-week prep work is coordination and clear communication.</p>

            <p>Here's how we make it work:</p>

            <p><strong>Quick Inspection:</strong> I walk through the property within 24 hours of the previous tenants leaving, document everything, and send a photo report with costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Immediate Quote and Timeline:</strong> You get a clear quote showing what can be done in the week and what would need more time. No surprises.</p>

            <p><strong>Daily Progress Updates:</strong> I send text updates showing what's been completed each day, plus photos of finished work.</p>

            <p><strong>Priority Service:</strong> Property managers get priority for urgent turnarounds — I understand that vacant days cost you money.</p>

            <p>I've worked with the same Northern Rivers property managers for years. They call me when they need reliable, fast turnarounds because they know the work will be done properly and on schedule.</p>

            <h2>What This Actually Costs for Byron Bay Rentals</h2>

            <p>Typical one-week turnaround costs for a 3-bedroom Byron Bay rental property:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial inspection and report:</strong> $120-$180</li>
                <li><strong>Minor repairs (doors, fixtures, touch-up painting):</strong> $300-$800</li>
                <li><strong>Professional clean:</strong> $350-$500</li>
                <li><strong>Carpet steam clean:</strong> $150-$250</li>
                <li><strong>Garden tidy and mowing:</strong> $150-$300</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Total typical cost: $1,070-$2,030</strong></p>

            <p>If the property needs more extensive work (full room repainting, deck restoration, major repairs), you're looking at longer timelines and higher costs. But for a standard turnover between tenants, $1,000-$2,000 gets most Byron Bay rental properties back to rent-ready condition.</p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes in Fast Turnarounds</h2>

            <p>I see landlords and property managers make the same mistakes when rushing turnarounds:</p>

            <p><strong>Skipping the inspection:</strong> You can't fix what you haven't documented. A proper inspection prevents surprises.</p>

            <p><strong>DIY cleaning to save money:</strong> Professional cleaners are faster and better. The $400 you save doing it yourself costs you $600 in vacancy days.</p>

            <p><strong>Ignoring outdoor areas:</strong> Byron Bay tenants care about outdoor space. A messy garden creates a bad first impression.</p>

            <p><strong>Not testing everything:</strong> New tenants will call you day one if something doesn't work. Test everything before handover.</p>

            <p><strong>Poor documentation:</strong> Without before/after photos, you'll have disputes at the end of the tenancy.</p>

            <p>One week is achievable, but only if you're organized and work with people who understand the urgency.</p>

            <h2>Beyond One Week: What If You Need More?</h2>

            <p>Some properties need more than a week. If yours requires extensive work — full repainting, deck restoration, major repairs — be realistic about timing.</p>

            <p>Better to delay the new tenancy by a week and have the property properly prepared than rush it and have tenants move into a half-finished job.</p>

            <p>I handled a Byron Bay rental last year where the landlord wanted a one-week turnaround, but the property needed two full rooms repainted, deck boards replaced, and the bathroom re-siliconed. I told him it would take 10 days minimum to do it properly. He agreed, and the property rented immediately at the asking price because it was presented professionally.</p>

            <p>Quality matters. Byron Bay's rental market is competitive — tenants have choices. A property that's properly prepared commands better rent and attracts better tenants.</p>

            <p>If you've got a Byron Bay rental that needs a fast turnaround between tenants, send me a message. I'll walk through it, give you a realistic timeline, and get it done properly. Most property managers in the Northern Rivers have my number on speed dial for exactly this situation.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">For a standard tenancy turnover (minor repairs, cleaning, touch-ups), yes. But if you need extensive work like full room repainting or deck restoration, you need 2-3 weeks minimum. I'll tell you honestly what's realistic for your timeline.</p>
