            <h1>How Much Does It Cost to Get a Byron Bay Home Ready for Tenants?</h1>

<p>You've got tenants moving into your Byron Bay property in three weeks. The previous tenants just moved out, and you need to know: how much is this going to cost to get it rent-ready? Every landlord and property manager in Byron Bay asks me this question. The answer depends on the property's condition, but I can give you realistic numbers based on dozens of rental turnarounds I've done across Byron Bay and the Northern Rivers.</p>

<p>Here's a complete cost breakdown for getting a Byron Bay property tenant-ready, plus what affects those costs and where you can save money without cutting corners.</p>

<h2>Basic Rent-Ready Turnaround: $850-$1,500</h2>

<p>For a standard 3-bedroom Byron Bay rental in reasonable condition (no major damage, just normal wear and tear between tenants), here's what a basic turnaround costs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Professional clean:</strong> $350-$500</li>
<li><strong>Minor repairs (door adjustments, handle replacements, touch-up painting):</strong> $200-$400</li>
<li><strong>Garden tidy and lawn mowing:</strong> $150-$250</li>
<li><strong>Gutter cleaning:</strong> $180-$280</li>
<li><strong>Carpet steam clean (if applicable):</strong> $150-$250</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total: $1,030-$1,680</strong></p>

<p>This assumes the property doesn't need repainting, major repairs, or significant renovation work. It's the cost to take a property from "previous tenants just left" to "new tenants can move in tomorrow."</p>

<h2>Mid-Range Turnaround: $2,500-$5,000</h2>

<p>If the property needs more work — some rooms need repainting, deck maintenance, fly screen repairs, or moderate wear and tear fixes — you're looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Everything from basic turnaround:</strong> $1,030-$1,680</li>
<li><strong>Repaint 2-3 rooms:</strong> $1,200-$2,400</li>
<li><strong>Deck clean and re-oil:</strong> $600-$1,200</li>
<li><strong>Fly screen repairs (3-4 screens):</strong> $240-$600</li>
<li><strong>Kitchen cupboard repairs and adjustments:</strong> $180-$350</li>
<li><strong>Bathroom re-siliconing:</strong> $220-$350</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total: $3,470-$6,580</strong></p>

<p>This level is common for Byron Bay properties that have had tenants for 2-3 years. Normal coastal wear and tear adds up — decks fade, paint marks accumulate, cupboards need attention.</p>

<h2>Extensive Turnaround: $6,000-$12,000+</h2>

<p>If your rental needs significant work before it's tenant-ready, costs escalate:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full interior repaint (3-bedroom):</strong> $3,500-$6,000</li>
<li><strong>Deck restoration (sanding, board replacement, re-oiling):</strong> $2,000-$5,000</li>
<li><strong>Fence repairs or replacement:</strong> $800-$3,000</li>
<li><strong>Kitchen or bathroom renovation:</strong> $3,000-$15,000</li>
<li><strong>Flooring replacement:</strong> $2,000-$8,000</li>
</ul>

<p>These costs apply when properties have been neglected, had problem tenants, or need upgrading to meet current rental market expectations in Byron Bay.</p>

<h2>What Affects Rental Prep Costs in Byron Bay?</h2>

<p><strong>Coastal Location:</strong> Properties close to the beach (Belongil, Suffolk Park, Wategos) need more frequent deck maintenance and exterior work due to salt air. This adds $500-$1,500 per turnaround compared to hinterland properties.</p>

<p><strong>Property Age:</strong> Older Byron Bay homes need more maintenance. Timber windows, weatherboard cladding, and aging infrastructure mean higher turnaround costs.</p>

<p><strong>Tenant Length:</strong> Short-term tenancies (6-12 months) usually need less work. Long-term tenancies (3+ years) often need repainting and more substantial maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Rental Market Expectations:</strong> Byron Bay's competitive rental market means properties need to be well-presented. Budget for quality finishes, not just "good enough."</p>

<h2>Where Landlords Can Save Money</h2>

<p>Smart ways to reduce turnaround costs without compromising quality:</p>

<p><strong>Preventative Maintenance:</strong> Annual gutter cleaning, deck oiling, and minor repairs during tenancy prevent expensive emergency work between tenants. $500/year in maintenance saves $2,000 in turnaround costs.</p>

<p><strong>Good Tenant Selection:</strong> Tenants who care for the property reduce damage. Work with property managers who screen properly.</p>

<p><strong>Keep Matched Paint:</strong> Store leftover paint from each room. Touch-ups cost $50-$150 vs $600-$1,000 to repaint entire rooms.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Quarterly property inspections catch small issues before they become expensive problems.</p>

<p><strong>Bundle Work:</strong> If you have multiple rentals, coordinate maintenance. Tradies often discount when doing several properties in one area.</p>

<h2>Costs Specific to Byron Bay Rentals</h2>

<p>Byron Bay has unique costs compared to other rental markets:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deck Maintenance:</strong> Almost every Byron Bay rental has a timber deck. Budget $600-$1,200 per turnaround for deck work.</li>
<li><strong>Mold Treatment:</strong> Byron's humidity breeds mold. Professional treatment costs $150-$400 per property.</li>
<li><strong>Garden Maintenance:</strong> Byron Bay tenants expect outdoor areas. Overgrown gardens reduce rental appeal. Budget $200-$500 for garden restoration.</li>
<li><strong>Fly Screens:</strong> Essential in Byron's climate. Worn screens need replacing regularly — $80-$150 each.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Property Managers Actually Charge</h2>

<p>Most Byron Bay property managers charge landlords for coordination of maintenance. Typical fees:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arranging quotes:</strong> Often free or included in management fee</li>
<li><strong>Supervision of work:</strong> 10-15% of job cost</li>
<li><strong>Emergency callouts:</strong> $80-$150 per callout</li>
</ul>

<p>Working directly with trades (like me) removes this markup. However, property managers provide value through tenant coordination and documentation.</p>

<h2>Real Examples from Byron Bay Rentals</h2>

<p>Last month I worked on three Byron Bay rental turnarounds:</p>

<p><strong>Suffolk Park 2-bedroom unit:</strong> Clean condition after 18-month tenancy. Professional clean ($380), minor door adjustments ($120), garden tidy ($180). Total: $680.</p>

<p><strong>Byron Bay 3-bedroom house:</strong> 3-year tenancy, moderate wear. Clean ($450), repaint 2 rooms ($1,600), deck re-oil ($800), gutter clean ($220), fly screen repairs ($320). Total: $3,390.</p>

<p><strong>Bangalow 4-bedroom cottage:</strong> Neglected property, new landlord upgrading for better rental return. Full interior repaint ($5,200), deck restoration ($3,800), bathroom re-grout and paint ($1,200), garden overhaul ($900), deep clean ($550). Total: $11,650.</p>

<p>The Bangalow property was extreme, but the landlord increased rent from $550/week to $750/week after the work. The investment paid off in 8 months.</p>

<p>Whether you're spending $1,000 or $10,000, the key is getting your Byron Bay rental properly presented. Well-maintained properties rent faster, command higher rent, and attract better tenants. Cutting corners to save $500 often costs you weeks of vacancy, which is far more expensive.</p>

<p>If you need a realistic quote for getting your Byron Bay rental property tenant-ready, send me photos and a description. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of what needs doing and what it'll cost. Most property managers and landlords in the Northern Rivers have my number for exactly this.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">Why does rental prep cost more in Byron Bay than other areas?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Byron Bay's coastal environment requires marine-grade materials and specialized maintenance. Decks need specific treatments, salt air damages fixtures faster, and the rental market expects high presentation standards. Quality work costs more but protects your investment.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">Can I save money by doing some of the work myself?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">If you're local and handy, yes. But if you're interstate, your time flying to Byron and back costs more than hiring someone local. DIY also risks mistakes that cost more to fix later. Professional work done right the first time is usually cheaper overall.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Depends on your rental target. Basic maintenance is fine for long-term rentals. If you're targeting Airbnb or premium rentals, upgrading fixtures, painting, and improving presentation gets you higher rental returns.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Get 2-3 quotes for major work. For Byron Bay, expect to pay 10-20% more than regional NSW due to coastal location and demand. Super cheap quotes often mean poor quality or corners being cut.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Absolutely. $500/year in preventative maintenance (gutter cleaning, deck oiling, minor repairs) prevents $2,000-5,000 in emergency repairs between tenants. It also reduces vacancy time because the property stays rent-ready.</p>
