            <h1>The Hidden Repairs Most New Byron Properties Need Before Move-In</h1>

            <p>You got the building inspection report. Structurally sound, no major issues. Settlement went through, the house is yours. Then you walk in for the first time as the owner and start noticing things. The screen door doesn't close properly. Kitchen cupboard doors are hanging crooked. There's a soft spot on the deck. The bathroom grouting is cracked and stained.</p>

            <p>This happens constantly in Byron Bay. Building inspectors focus on structural problems, pests, and major defects. They're not looking at all the small-to-medium repairs that actually affect whether you can move in comfortably. I see these hidden issues on almost every property I inspect for new owners around Byron Bay and the Northern Rivers. Here's what to expect and what to fix before you unload the truck.</p>

            <h2>Deck Structure Under the Boards</h2>

            <p>Everyone walks on the deck boards. But how many people get underneath and check the bearers and joists? Almost nobody. And that's where I find problems.</p>

            <p>In Byron Bay's coastal humidity, the timber structure underneath decks rots faster than the visible boards on top. I crawl under every deck I inspect, and here's what I commonly find:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Joist ends rotting where they meet the bearers</li>
                <li>Post bases sitting in damp ground (should be concrete footings)</li>
                <li>Rusted brackets and hangers that need replacing</li>
                <li>White rot fungus growing on structural timber</li>
                <li>Termite activity (especially if timber touches the ground)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Building inspectors might note "deck requires maintenance," but that doesn't tell you half the joists are rotting. I replaced substructure on a Bangalow property last year — looked fine from above, completely rotten underneath. Cost $4,200 to fix, but the alternative was the deck collapsing.</p>

            <p>Before you move in, get someone to inspect the deck structure properly. It's easier and cheaper to replace rotting timber now than after you're living there.</p>

            <h2>Kitchen Cupboard Doors and Hinges</h2>

            <p>Byron Bay humidity wrecks kitchen cupboards. Doors swell, hinges sag, nothing closes properly. I get called to fix this on almost every second property I work on.</p>

            <p>Common problems:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Doors won't close or spring back open (hinges have sagged)</li>
                <li>Doors rub on the frame or each other (timber has swollen)</li>
                <li>Soft-close mechanisms have failed</li>
                <li>Handles and knobs are loose or missing</li>
                <li>Doors are warped from moisture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Fixing this takes 2-4 hours depending on how many cupboards need work. I realign hinges, plane down swollen edges, replace broken soft-close units, and tighten all the handles. Typical cost: $180-$350 for a full kitchen.</p>

            <p>Do this before you move in. Once the kitchen's full of your stuff, it's harder to work on and you're stuck cooking in a kitchen where half the cupboards won't close.</p>

            <h2>Bathroom Silicone and Grouting</h2>

            <p>Old, cracked bathroom silicone and grouting looks bad, but more importantly it lets water through. Water gets behind tiles, into walls, under the floor. That causes mold, rot, and expensive damage.</p>

            <p>On almost every Byron Bay property I inspect, the bathroom silicone is deteriorated. It's cracked, stained, peeling away from the tiles, or just plain missing in sections.</p>

            <p>I also see:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cracked or missing grout between tiles</li>
                <li>Black mold growing in grout lines</li>
                <li>Silicone around the bath or shower base failing</li>
                <li>Water stains on the ceiling from moisture seeping up</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Re-siliconing a bathroom properly (remove old silicone, clean, apply new) costs $220-$350. Regrouting a shower costs $350-$600 depending on size. It's not glamorous work, but it protects your property from water damage.</p>

            <p>Do this before move-in. Bathrooms are easier to work on when they're empty, and you don't want to discover a leak after you've moved in all your belongings.</p>

            <h2>Flyscreens Are Usually Wrecked</h2>

            <p>Byron Bay without flyscreens in summer is miserable. But I reckon 70% of properties I inspect have at least one broken or torn flyscreen.</p>

            <p>Common issues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Torn or holey mesh (useless for keeping insects out)</li>
                <li>Screen door frames that are bent or won't close</li>
                <li>Missing screen door closers or latches</li>
                <li>Screens so old the mesh has degraded from UV</li>
                <li>Screens that were removed and never reinstalled</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Replacing flyscreen mesh costs $80-$150 per screen. Fixing a screen door frame (straightening, new closer, new latch) costs $120-$200.</p>

            <p>I worked on a Suffolk Park property last summer where every single screen was torn or missing. The new owners moved in without fixing them — within two days they were getting eaten alive by mosquitoes and midges. We ended up replacing 8 screens in 30-degree heat while they were living there. Should've been done before move-in.</p>

            <h2>Doors That Don't Close Properly</h2>

            <p>Humidity makes timber doors swell. Hinges work loose over time. Latches stop aligning. The result: doors that stick, drag, won't close, or won't latch.</p>

            <p>Almost every Byron Bay property I inspect has at least 2-3 doors that need adjustment. Common problems:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bedroom doors that drag on the floor or frame</li>
                <li>Bathroom doors that won't stay closed</li>
                <li>Front or back doors that won't lock properly</li>
                <li>Wardrobe doors that have sagged on their hinges</li>
                <li>Screen doors that swing open or won't latch</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Fixing this usually means planing down swollen edges, tightening or repositioning hinges, adjusting latches, and lubricating locks. Takes 15-30 minutes per door. Typical cost for sorting out 4-5 problem doors: $180-$280.</p>

            <p>Get doors working before you move in. You don't want to be wrestling with a stuck bathroom door every morning while you're trying to settle into your new Byron Bay home.</p>

            <h2>Gutters Are Probably Blocked</h2>

            <p>If the previous owners didn't maintain the gutters (and most don't), they're probably full of leaves, dirt, and debris. Blocked gutters cause water to overflow during storms, which damages fascia boards, causes leaks, and dumps water where you don't want it.</p>

            <p>I clean gutters on probably 60% of the properties I prep for new Byron Bay owners. Common findings:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Years of leaf litter compacted in the gutters</li>
                <li>Small plants actually growing in the built-up debris</li>
                <li>Downpipes completely blocked</li>
                <li>Rust holes in old metal gutters</li>
                <li>Sagging sections where brackets have failed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Gutter cleaning for a standard Byron Bay property costs $180-$280. If sections need repairing or replacing, that's additional, but at least you'll know what needs doing.</p>

            <p>Do this before Byron Bay's wet season (December through March). Discovering your gutters are blocked during a storm is not fun.</p>

            <h2>Timber Window Frames Are Rotting</h2>

            <p>Older Byron Bay properties have timber window frames. Salt air and weather attack them. I regularly find rotting sills, deteriorated frames, and windows that won't open or close.</p>

            <p>Check all window frames carefully:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Press on the sill — if it's soft, it's rotting</li>
                <li>Look for peeling paint (means moisture is getting in)</li>
                <li>Test if windows open and close smoothly</li>
                <li>Check the putty or seals around the glass</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Repairing a rotting window frame costs $180-$400 depending on how much timber needs replacing. Repainting timber windows costs $80-$150 per window.</p>

            <p>I replaced window sills on a Lennox Head property last winter. Building inspector had noted "minor timber deterioration." Turns out three sills were completely rotted and needed replacing. New owner hadn't budgeted for it, but it had to be done before the next rainstorm.</p>

            <h2>Hot Water System Is Older Than You Think</h2>

            <p>Check the date stamp on the hot water system. If it's over 10 years old, it's on borrowed time. I see a lot of systems in Byron Bay properties that are 12-15 years old, still working, but likely to fail in the next year or two.</p>

            <p>Building inspectors will note the age, but they don't tell you to budget for replacement. A new hot water system (supply and install) costs $1,200-$2,500 depending on type and size.</p>

            <p>If your hot water system is ancient, at least be aware you might need to replace it soon. It's not something you want failing in winter when you've got a house full of people.</p>

            <h2>How I Work with Remote Property Owners</h2>

            <p>Most of my Byron Bay property prep work is for owners who are still interstate. You've bought the place, but you won't arrive for another month. You need someone local who can inspect properly, tell you what's actually wrong, and fix it before you get there.</p>

            <p>Here's my process:</p>

            <p><strong>Inspection and Photo Report:</strong> I spend 90 minutes walking through your property, checking everything. Then I send you a detailed photo report showing every issue I found, with cost estimates for repairs.</p>

            <p><strong>Clear Prioritization:</strong> I tell you what's urgent (safety or water damage), what's important (affects livability), and what can wait. You decide what gets fixed now and what you'll deal with later.</p>

            <p><strong>Transparent Quotes:</strong> Every repair gets a clear price before I start. No surprises, no "oh by the way" extra costs. If I find additional problems during the work, I message you with photos and a quote before proceeding.</p>

            <p><strong>Progress Updates:</strong> I send photos as the work progresses. You see what I'm seeing — the problem, the repair process, and the finished result.</p>

            <p>I've prepared dozens of Byron Bay properties for interstate owners. The key is clear communication and treating your property like I'd want mine treated — thoroughly, professionally, and honestly.</p>

            <h2>What This Actually Costs</h2>

            <p>Typical costs for fixing common hidden repairs on a Byron Bay property:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deck substructure repairs:</strong> $800-$4,000 (depends on extent of rot)</li>
                <li><strong>Kitchen cupboards sorted:</strong> $180-$350</li>
                <li><strong>Bathroom re-siliconing:</strong> $220-$350</li>
                <li><strong>Flyscreen repairs:</strong> $80-$150 per screen</li>
                <li><strong>Door adjustments (5 doors):</strong> $180-$280</li>
                <li><strong>Gutter cleaning:</strong> $180-$280</li>
                <li><strong>Window frame repairs:</strong> $180-$400 per window</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Total for typical hidden repairs on a standard 3-bedroom Byron Bay property: <strong>$1,800-$4,500</strong></p>

            <p>Not every property needs all of this. Some are in great shape. Others need more work. The important thing is knowing what you're dealing with before you commit to a moving date.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay properties are beautiful, but they need maintenance — especially in the coastal climate. Identifying and fixing hidden repairs before move-in means you arrive to a home that's actually ready to live in, not a project you have to tackle while unpacking boxes.</p>

            <p>If you've just bought in Byron Bay and want a proper pre-move-in inspection, send me a message. I'll walk through the property, document everything, and give you a realistic quote for getting it sorted.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Building inspectors focus on structural issues, pests, and major defects that affect property value. They're not checking if cupboard doors close properly, if flyscreens work, or if silicone needs replacing—things that affect livability but not structural safety.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">Can I get these repairs done before settlement?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Sometimes, but it depends on your contract and the seller's cooperation. Most commonly, these repairs are done in the 1-2 weeks after settlement before you move in, while the property is still empty.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2D3748; margin-bottom: 8px;">How do you check deck substructure without damaging anything?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">I crawl underneath the deck with a torch and inspect bearers, joists, and posts. I also walk the deck feeling for soft spots and test railings for stability. It's non-invasive inspection that identifies problems without causing damage.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">Deck substructure rot. Everyone looks at the deck boards, but the timber underneath rots first in Byron's coastal humidity. I find this on about 60% of Byron Bay properties I inspect for new owners.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #4A5568; line-height: 1.6;">I prioritize repairs into urgent (safety or prevents damage), important (affects livability), and can wait (cosmetic). Fix urgent and important before move-in. Cosmetic stuff can wait until you're settled in.</p>
