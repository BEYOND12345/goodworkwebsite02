                    <p class="lead">Another Byron Bay storm just hit. Your roof might be leaking, fence might be down, power could be out. You're standing in your kitchen at 6am listening to water dripping somewhere it shouldn't be, wondering what got damaged and what needs immediate attention.</p>

                    <p>I've been helping Byron Bay property owners recover from storm damage. From king tides flooding Jonson Street to severe winds tearing through Suffolk Park, I've seen every type of coastal storm impact. Here's your step-by-step guide for what to check first, what's urgent, and what can wait.</p>

                    <p><strong>First priority: safety. Second priority: preventing more damage. Everything else can be sorted out once you're safe and dry.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Immediate Safety Assessment (Do This First)</h2>

                    <h3>Check for Electrical Hazards</h3>

                    <p><strong>Before You Do Anything Else</strong>: If there's any flooding or water where it shouldn't be, turn off power at the main switchboard. Water and electricity kill people.</p>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <h4>Warning Signs to Watch For:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Water near power outlets or electrical equipment</li>
                            <li>Sparking or buzzing sounds from electrical areas</li>
                            <li>Burning smells that could indicate electrical problems</li>
                            <li>Downed power lines anywhere on your property</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>If You See Electrical Hazards</strong>: Don't touch anything. Call 000 immediately and stay away from the area.</p>

                    <h3>Structural Damage Assessment</h3>

                    <p><strong>Look for Immediate Dangers</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sagging ceilings that could collapse</li>
                        <li>Cracked walls or significant structural movement</li>
                        <li>Damaged stairs or railings that could cause falls</li>
                        <li>Broken glass or debris in walkways</li>
                        <li>Trees or large branches threatening to fall</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>If You Find Structural Problems</strong>: Evacuate that area immediately. These aren't DIY repairs - they need professional assessment before anyone goes back in.</p>

                    <h3>Water Damage Evaluation</h3>

                    <p><strong>Check These Areas First</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ceiling stains or bulging that indicate roof leaks</li>
                        <li>Water pooling inside the house</li>
                        <li>Flooding in basements or lower levels</li>
                        <li>Wet carpets or furnishings that could develop mold</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Immediate Actions</strong>: Move valuable items away from leaks, place buckets under drips, document everything with photos for insurance.</p>

                    <h2>Byron Bay Storm Damage Checklist</h2>

                    <h3>Roof and Gutters (Most Common Problems)</h3>

                    <p><strong>What to Look For</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Missing or displaced roof tiles</li>
                        <li>Gutters hanging loose or completely detached</li>
                        <li>Downpipes bent or disconnected</li>
                        <li>Flashing around chimneys or vents damaged</li>
                        <li>Water stains on interior ceilings</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>From the Ground</strong>: Never get on a wet roof after a storm. Use binoculars if you have them, or take photos with your phone zoomed in.</p>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <h4>Immediate Fixes:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place tarps over obvious holes (if safely accessible)</li>
                            <li>Clear blocked gutters if you can do so safely</li>
                            <li>Redirect water away from the house foundation</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Properties Near the Beach</strong>: Salt-loaded storm winds cause extra corrosion damage to roof fixtures. Even if nothing looks obviously broken, hardware may have been compromised.</p>

                    <h3>Fence and Gate Damage</h3>

                    <p><strong>Common Byron Bay Storm Damage</strong>:</p>

                        <li>Posts pulled out of sandy coastal soil</li>
                        <li>Pool fencing compromised (safety priority)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Safety Priorities</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Secure any fencing that could injure people or damage property</li>
                        <li>Check pool fence integrity immediately if you have a pool</li>
                        <li>Clear fence debris from driveways and walkways</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="process-section">
                        <h4>Temporary Solutions:</h4>
                        <ul>

                    </div>

                    <p><strong>What Storms Do to Byron Bay Decks</strong>:</p>

                    <h2>Emergency Repairs vs. What Can Wait</h2>

                    <h3>Do These Immediately (Safety and Further Damage Prevention)</h3>

                    <div class="urgent-repairs">
                        <h4>Stop Water Entry:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tarp damaged roof areas if safely accessible</li>
                            <li>Cover broken windows with boards or plastic sheeting</li>
                            <li>Clear blocked drains and gutters to prevent overflow</li>
                            <li>Move valuable items away from leaks</li>

                        <h4>Secure Property:</h4>

                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Document Everything</strong>: Take photos of all damage before making any temporary repairs. Insurance companies need to see the initial damage.</p>

                    <h3>What Can Wait (But Don't Ignore)</h3>

                    <p><strong>Cosmetic Damage</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Paint damage that doesn't affect structure</li>
                        <li>Minor scratches or dents that don't compromise function</li>
                        <li>Landscaping damage (unless blocking access or creating hazards)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Non-Critical Repairs</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Internal painting where water damage has occurred</li>
                        <li>Replacing damaged outdoor furniture</li>
                        <li>Detailed cleanup and restoration work</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>System Checks</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full electrical system inspection (once power is restored)</li>
                        <li>Plumbing system assessment</li>
                        <li>HVAC system evaluation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Insurance and Documentation</h2>

                    <h3>Document Everything Before Cleanup</h3>

                    <p><strong>Photo Requirements</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall property damage from multiple angles</li>
                        <li>Close-up shots of specific damage</li>
                        <li>Interior damage including water stains and flooding</li>
                        <li>Damaged personal property and furnishings</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Written Documentation</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Date and time of storm</li>
                        <li>Description of weather conditions</li>
                        <li>Timeline of when damage was discovered</li>
                        <li>Initial emergency measures taken</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Keep Records Of</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Emergency repair costs and receipts</li>
                        <li>Communication with insurance companies</li>
                        <li>Contact information for contractors and assessors</li>
                        <li>Temporary accommodation costs if needed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Understanding Your Coverage</h3>

                    <p><strong>Storm vs. Flood Damage</strong>: Insurance policies often treat these differently. Understanding the distinction affects your claim process.</p>

                    <p><strong>Gradual Deterioration</strong>: Pre-existing problems that storms make worse aren't usually covered. Document that damage is clearly storm-related.</p>

                    <p><strong>Emergency Repairs</strong>: Most policies allow immediate repairs to prevent further damage. Keep receipts and take photos before and after emergency work.</p>

                    <p><strong>Temporary Accommodation</strong>: If your property becomes unlivable, check if your policy covers alternative accommodation costs.</p>

                    <h2>Storm-Proofing for Next Time</h2>

                    <h3>Preventive Roof Maintenance</h3>

                    <p><strong>Regular Inspections</strong>: Annual professional roof checks identify loose tiles and deteriorated flashing before storms hit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Gutter Maintenance</strong>: Clean gutters and secure mounting systems. Blocked gutters overflow and cause water damage.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tree Management</strong>: Trim branches away from roof lines. Properties near native vegetation need extra attention.</p>

                    <h3>Fence and Gate Preparation</h3>

                    <p><strong>Post Installation</strong>: Coastal sandy soils require deeper post installation and better drainage around posts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wind-Resistant Design</strong>: Panels with gaps or slats perform better in high winds than solid panels.</p>

                    <p><strong>Quality Hardware</strong>: Marine-grade hinges and latches last longer and fail less catastrophically.</p>

                    <h3>Window and Door Protection</h3>

                    <p><strong>Storm Shutters</strong>: Permanent or removable shutters provide the best protection for windows.</p>

                    <p><strong>Impact-Resistant Glass</strong>: Upgrade options for windows in storm-prone areas.</p>

                    <p><strong>Security Screens</strong>: Quality security screens provide some storm protection while improving everyday security.</p>

                    <h2>Why Local Storm Experience Matters</h2>

                    <h3>Understanding Byron Bay Storm Patterns</h3>

                    <p><strong>Seasonal Variations</strong>: December-March brings severe thunderstorms and potential cyclone activity. April-August typically has different storm types with less wind but heavy rain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Local Wind Patterns</strong>: Properties in different parts of Byron Bay face different prevailing winds and exposure levels.</p>

                    <p><strong>Coastal vs. Hinterland</strong>: Properties near the beach face different challenges than those toward Mullumbimby.</p>

                    <h3>Material Knowledge for Coastal Repairs</h3>

                    <p><strong>Salt Air Considerations</strong>: Storm repairs must use materials that handle ongoing salt exposure, not just immediate weather.</p>

                    <p><strong>Humidity Factors</strong>: Repair materials must cope with Byron Bay's high humidity levels during the drying and curing process.</p>

                    <p><strong>Local Regulations</strong>: Byron Shire has specific requirements for storm damage repairs, especially in heritage areas.</p>

                    <h2>Getting Professional Storm Damage Help</h2>

                    <p>Don't try to handle major storm damage alone. Byron Bay's coastal conditions require specific expertise for repairs that last. Quick patches using inappropriate materials often fail within months, creating bigger problems.</p>

                    <p>Professional storm damage assessment identifies hidden problems that aren't obvious immediately after a storm. Salt air accelerates corrosion damage, humidity affects drying times, and coastal building techniques differ from inland approaches.</p>

                    <p>Emergency repairs need to be done right the first time. Insurance companies expect professional standards, and shortcuts can void coverage or create safety hazards.</p>

                    <p>Most storm damage I see could have been minimized with better preventive maintenance. But once damage occurs, proper professional repair using appropriate materials designed for coastal conditions is essential.</p>
