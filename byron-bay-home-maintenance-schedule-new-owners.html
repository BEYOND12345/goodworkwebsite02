            <h1>Byron Bay Home Maintenance Schedule for New Homeowners</h1>

            <p>You just bought a property in Byron Bay. Congratulations — and welcome to coastal property ownership. Here's something most new Byron Bay homeowners don't realize: maintenance schedules from Brisbane or Sydney don't work here. Salt air, high UV, humidity, and coastal weather mean Byron Bay properties need different care at different frequencies.</p>

            <p>I've maintained Byron Bay properties for years, and I've seen what happens when owners follow "normal" maintenance schedules versus Byron Bay-specific ones. The difference is thousands of dollars in preventable repairs. Here's the actual maintenance schedule you need for a Byron Bay property — monthly, quarterly, and annual tasks that keep your investment protected.</p>

            <h2>Monthly Tasks (15 Minutes)</h2>

            <p>These quick monthly checks prevent small problems becoming expensive repairs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hose down decks and outdoor timber:</strong> Removes salt buildup from Byron's coastal air. Takes 10 minutes, prevents thousands in rot damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Check for new leaks:</strong> Quick visual check under sinks, around toilets, and ceiling stain checks after rain.</li>
                <li><strong>Test smoke alarms:</strong> Press the test button on each alarm.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear leaves from gutters (visual check):</strong> You don't need to clean monthly, but check if leaves are building up.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That monthly deck hose-down is critical in Byron Bay. Salt air deposits salt on timber every day. Hosing removes it before it draws moisture and causes rot. Properties within 500m of the ocean should do this weekly.</p>

            <h2>Quarterly Tasks (2-3 Hours)</h2>

            <p>Every three months, dedicate a morning to these maintenance tasks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep check all doors and windows:</strong> Test locks, check for swelling, lubricate hinges.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect deck for damage:</strong> Walk every board, check for soft spots, loose fixings, or splinters.</li>
                <li><strong>Check and treat mold:</strong> Byron's humidity breeds mold. Check wardrobes, bathrooms, under sinks.</li>
                <li><strong>Test all taps for drips:</strong> A dripping tap wastes water (expensive in Byron) and causes damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect exterior timber:</strong> Check window frames, weatherboards, fascia for paint deterioration or rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean fly screens:</strong> Salt and dirt clog mesh. Vacuum or hose them clean.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The deck inspection is crucial. I find deck problems on almost every quarterly inspection I do in Byron Bay. Catching a rotting board early costs $80 to replace. Miss it for a year and you're replacing 10 boards for $800.</p>

            <h2>Twice-Yearly Tasks (Before and After Storm Season)</h2>

            <p>Do these in October (before summer storms) and April (after storm season):</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional gutter cleaning:</strong> $180-$280, prevents water damage worth thousands.</li>
                <li><strong>Deck oil or treatment:</strong> Byron's UV and weather strips deck protection fast. Re-oil every 12-18 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Check roof (from ground):</strong> Look for missing tiles, damaged flashing, or obvious issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Test hot water system:</strong> Check for leaks, rust, or strange noises. Hot water systems fail without warning.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect fencing:</strong> Byron's weather damages fences. Check for loose palings, rotting posts, rusted fixings.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Gutter cleaning before Byron's wet season (December-March) is non-negotiable. Blocked gutters overflow during storms, causing water damage to walls, ceilings, and foundations.</p>

            <h2>Annual Tasks (Full Day or Hire a Professional)</h2>

            <p>Once a year, do a comprehensive property maintenance day:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full deck restoration (if needed):</strong> Sand, treat, re-oil, replace damaged boards.</li>
                <li><strong>Exterior repaint touch-ups:</strong> Byron's sun damages exterior paint. Touch up before it becomes full repainting.</li>
                <li><strong>Bathroom re-siliconing:</strong> Old silicone fails in Byron's humidity. Replace every 2-3 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest inspection:</strong> Byron Bay has termites. Annual inspections catch them before serious damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Air conditioner service:</strong> If you have aircon, annual service prevents breakdowns in summer.</li>
                <li><strong>Pool and pump service:</strong> If you have a pool, annual professional service is essential.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Byron Bay Seasonal Considerations</h2>

            <p><strong>Summer (December-February):</strong> Storm season. Check gutters, secure outdoor furniture, trim trees near the house.</p>

            <p><strong>Autumn (March-May):</strong> Post-storm repairs. Check for damage, clean up debris, inspect roof and fencing.</p>

            <p><strong>Winter (June-August):</strong> Mold season. Byron's winter humidity creates mold. Increase ventilation, check for mold growth.</p>

            <p><strong>Spring (September-November):</strong> Pre-summer prep. Deck restoration, gutter cleaning, garden prep for growth season.</p>

            <h2>What Happens If You Skip Maintenance</h2>

            <p>I worked on a Bangalow property last year where the owner had done zero maintenance for three years. The result:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deck completely rotted — $4,500 to replace</li>
                <li>Gutters so blocked they'd caused ceiling water damage — $2,200 repair</li>
                <li>Exterior paint completely failed — $6,500 to repaint</li>
                <li>Bathroom silicone failed causing hidden water damage — $1,800 to fix</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Total cost: $15,000 in repairs that could've been prevented with $2,000 in annual maintenance.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay coastal properties punish neglect. Maintenance isn't optional here — it's protecting your investment.</p>

                <h3>Byron Bay Maintenance Checklist</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>✓ Monthly: Hose decks, check leaks, test smoke alarms</li>
                    <li>✓ Quarterly: Inspect deck, check mold, test doors/windows</li>
                    <li>✓ Twice-yearly: Clean gutters, re-oil deck, check roof</li>
                    <li>✓ Annually: Full property inspection, pest check, major maintenance</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Remote Owner Maintenance Programs</h2>

            <p>If you're managing a Byron Bay property from interstate, I offer quarterly maintenance programs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I visit the property every 3 months</li>
                <li>Complete the quarterly checklist</li>
                <li>Photo documentation of everything</li>
                <li>Report of any issues found</li>
                <li>Quote for repairs if needed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cost: $180-$280 per quarterly visit. Many interstate property owners use this service — it's cheaper than flying to Byron every quarter, and you get professional eyes on your property regularly.</p>

            <p>Byron Bay property ownership requires consistent maintenance, but it's manageable with the right schedule. Stick to monthly, quarterly, and annual tasks, and your property stays in great condition. Neglect it, and Byron's coastal environment will cost you thousands in avoidable repairs.</p>

            <p>If you're a new Byron Bay or Northern Rivers homeowner and want help setting up a maintenance schedule or need someone local to handle it for you, send me a message. I work with dozens of Byron Bay property owners — both local and remote — keeping their properties properly maintained year-round.</p>
