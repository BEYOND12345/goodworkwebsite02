            <h1>The Smart Way to Line Up Trades Before You Move to Byron</h1>

            <p>You're moving to Byron Bay in six weeks. Settlement's done, you own the property, but you're still in Melbourne packing boxes. You know the Byron Bay house needs work before move-in — painting, deck repairs, minor fixes — but organizing it from interstate feels overwhelming. Who do you call? How do you coordinate work when you can't be on-site? What if trades don't show up or do poor work while you're 800km away?</p>

            <p>I help interstate movers organize property work before arrival every month. Here's the smart way to line up trades and get everything done properly before your moving truck arrives in Byron Bay — even when you're coordinating it all remotely from Brisbane, Sydney, or Melbourne.</p>

            <h2>Start 4-6 Weeks Before Move-In</h2>

            <p>Don't wait until the week before moving. Good trades in Byron Bay book out weeks ahead. Start organizing work immediately after settlement, ideally 4-6 weeks before your move-in date.</p>

            <p>This timeline gives you:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Time to find reliable trades (not just whoever answers first)</li>
                <li>Flexibility if work takes longer than quoted</li>
                <li>Buffer for unexpected issues you discover</li>
                <li>Less stress coordinating remotely</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I had a couple moving from Sydney to Byron who contacted me three weeks before their moving date. They needed deck restoration, two rooms repainted, and minor repairs. Normally 2-week jobs, but everyone was booked. We squeezed it in, but it was stressful for them. Starting early removes that pressure.</p>

            <h2>Get a Pre-Move Inspection First</h2>

            <p>Before organizing any trades, get someone local to do a comprehensive walk-through and send you a photo report. This tells you exactly what needs doing and in what order.</p>

            <p>The inspection should cover:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Urgent repairs (safety or prevents damage)</li>
                <li>Important fixes (affects livability or presentation)</li>
                <li>Nice-to-haves (can wait until after move-in)</li>
                <li>Cost estimates for each item</li>
                <li>Recommended timeline</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cost: $120-$250. Worth every dollar because it prevents you organizing the wrong work or missing critical issues.</p>

            <p>Once you have the inspection report, you can prioritize. Maybe you thought repainting was urgent, but actually the deck's rotting and needs immediate attention. The inspection gives you facts to make smart decisions.</p>

            <h2>Find Trades Through Local Networks</h2>

            <p>Random Google searches rarely work well for Byron Bay trades. Better sources:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your real estate agent:</strong> They know reliable local trades</li>
                <li><strong>Your conveyancer:</strong> Works with Byron Bay owners constantly, knows who's good</li>
                <li><strong>Local property managers:</strong> Even if you're not renting it out, they coordinate trades daily</li>
                <li><strong>Byron Bay community Facebook groups:</strong> Ask for recommendations, you'll get honest feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Friends or family in the area:</strong> Personal referrals are gold</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you contact trades, be specific: "I'm moving to Byron Bay from Melbourne in 5 weeks. Need deck re-oiled, 2 rooms repainted, minor door repairs. Property is vacant. Can you quote and do the work before [date]?"</p>

            <p>This tells them you're organized, have a deadline, and the property's accessible. You'll get better responses.</p>

            <h2>Coordinate One Main Person</h2>

            <p>Trying to coordinate a painter, handyman, cleaner, and gardener separately from interstate is chaos. Instead, find one main point of contact who can coordinate the rest.</p>

            <p>This is often a handyman or property maintenance person who:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Does general work themselves (repairs, minor painting, etc.)</li>
                <li>Coordinates specialists when needed (electricians, plumbers)</li>
                <li>Has keys and site access</li>
                <li>Sends you regular photo updates</li>
                <li>Provides a single invoice covering all work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I do this for interstate movers constantly. They deal with me, I coordinate any additional trades needed, and they get progress updates without chasing five different people.</p>

            <p>Cost: Usually the same as hiring trades individually, because experienced coordinators have trade relationships and negotiate fair prices.</p>

            <h2>Organize Site Access Early</h2>

            <p>Trades can't work without site access. Before anyone starts, arrange:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keys:</strong> Who has them? Real estate agent? Neighbor? Lockbox?</li>
                <li><strong>Access times:</strong> When can trades access the property?</li>
                <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Is there onsite parking or street parking?</li>
                <li><strong>Power and water:</strong> Are utilities connected for trades to use?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Tell trades upfront: "Keys are with [real estate agent], available Monday-Friday 8am-5pm. Onsite parking available. Power and water connected."</p>

            <p>Removing these friction points means trades can actually start work instead of waiting for keys or site access.</p>

            <h2>Set Clear Expectations for Remote Work</h2>

            <p>When organizing work remotely, be explicit about what you need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Written quotes:</strong> "Can you email a written quote before starting?"</li>
                <li><strong>Photo updates:</strong> "Please send photos before starting, during work, and when finished"</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> "Text updates are fine, I don't need daily calls but want to know progress"</li>
                <li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> "Happy to pay 50% deposit, 50% on completion with final photos"</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> "Work must be completed by [date] as that's when we're moving in"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Good trades appreciate clear expectations. It tells them you're organized and serious.</p>

            <h2>Prioritize Work Order Logically</h2>

            <p>Some work needs to happen in a specific order:</p>

            <p><strong>Week 1-2 (4-6 weeks before move):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Structural or urgent repairs (rotting deck, leaking roof, broken locks)</li>
                <li>Any work requiring specialists (electricians, plumbers)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Week 3-4 (2-4 weeks before move):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Painting (easier when property's empty)</li>
                <li>Deck restoration or sanding</li>
                <li>Any messy renovation work</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Week 5 (1 week before move):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Final repairs and touch-ups</li>
                <li>Professional clean</li>
                <li>Garden tidy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This sequence means messy work happens first, finishing work happens last, and you arrive to a clean, ready property.</p>

            <h2>Budget for Unexpected Issues</h2>

            <p>Almost every Byron Bay property reveals additional problems once work starts. Budget 15-20% extra for unexpected issues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deck restoration reveals rotted joists underneath</li>
                <li>Repainting reveals water damage needing repair first</li>
                <li>Minor repairs reveal bigger underlying problems</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you budgeted $5,000 for pre-move work, have $6,000-6,500 available. Better to have it and not need it than get stuck when urgent repairs appear.</p>

            <h2>Stay in Regular Communication</h2>

            <p>When coordinating remotely, communication prevents problems:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ask for photo updates every 2-3 days</li>
                <li>Respond quickly when trades message you with questions</li>
                <li>If something doesn't look right in photos, ask immediately</li>
                <li>Stay accessible by phone during business hours</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I worked with a Bangalow buyer who was excellent at this — responded to messages within hours, made decisions quickly, trusted the process but stayed informed. Work flowed smoothly because communication was clear both ways.</p>

            <h2>Plan Cleaning Last</h2>

            <p>Don't clean before work starts. Clean after all messy work is finished, ideally 2-3 days before your moving truck arrives.</p>

            <p>Professional clean for a 3-bedroom Byron Bay property: $350-$500. Worth it after painting, repairs, and renovations. The house will be properly clean, not just "tidy."</p>

            <h2>What If Things Go Wrong?</h2>

            <p>Sometimes work runs late or problems arise. Have a backup plan:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexible moving date:</strong> If possible, have a 3-5 day buffer on your move-in date</li>
                <li><strong>Temporary accommodation:</strong> Know where you'll stay in Byron if the house isn't quite ready</li>
                <li><strong>Essential vs nice-to-have:</strong> Know what MUST be done before move-in vs what can wait</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Most of the time, organized pre-move work in Byron Bay runs smoothly. But coastal properties occasionally surprise you, so flexibility helps.</p>

            <h2>Real Example: Melbourne to Lennox Head Move</h2>

            <p>Last year I coordinated pre-move work for a family moving from Melbourne to Lennox Head. Six weeks before their move:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> I did the inspection, sent photo report, they approved work</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2-3:</strong> Deck restoration, repainted 3 rooms, minor repairs</li>
                <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Electrician fixed faulty power points, plumber fixed dripping taps</li>
                <li><strong>Week 5:</strong> Final touch-ups, fly screen repairs</li>
                <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> Professional clean, garden tidy, final walk-through with photos</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They arrived to a property that was clean, repaired, and ready. Total cost: $4,800. They said it was the least stressful part of their interstate move.</p>

            <p>That's how it should work. Start early, find reliable people, communicate clearly, and organize work logically. You'll arrive to a Byron Bay home that's actually ready to live in, not a construction site you have to finish while unpacking.</p>

            <p>If you're moving to Byron Bay or the Northern Rivers and need help coordinating pre-move property work, send me a message. I work with interstate movers regularly and have the process down to a system that works smoothly even when you're coordinating everything from another state.</p>
